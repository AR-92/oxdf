I wrote a blog post for the HackTheBox blog, [Exploiting the Looney
Tunables Vulnerability on HTB
(CVE-2023-4911)](https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/exploiting-the-looney-tunables-vulnerability-cve-2023-4911).
In the post, I'll give an overview of the vulnerability and how
exploitation works (at a high level), and then show how to run one of
the proof of concept (POC) exploits against the HackTheBox
[TwoMillion](https://www.hackthebox.com/machines/TwoMillion) machine.
I'll also look at how to detect Looney Tunables exploitation in Linux
log files.

To try it on TwoMillion without reading the walkthrough, the follow
creds will work for SSH access:

-   Username: admin
-   Password: SuperDuperPass123

There are also three new Guided Mode questions at the end of the box
regarding Looney Tunables. You can use these questions whether you've
completed TwoMillion or not.
